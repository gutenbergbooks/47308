<h2><a id="The_Sanitary_Evolution_of_London"></a>The Sanitary Evolution of London</h2>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="chaptHeadSpecial">CHAPTER I</p>

<p class="p1 noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> health of the people of a country stands foremost in
the rank of national considerations. Upon their health
depends their physical strength and energy, upon it their
mental vigour, their individual happiness, and, in a great
degree, their moral character. Upon it, moreover, depends
the productivity of their labour, and the material prosperity
and commercial success of their country. Ultimately, upon
it depends the very existence of the nation and of the
Empire.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom can claim no exemption from this
general principle; rather, indeed, is it one which, in the
present period of our history, affects us more vitally than it
has ever done before, and in a more crucial manner than
it does many other nations.</p>

<p>The more imperative is it, therefore, that every effort
should be made to raise the health of our people to the
highest attainable level, and to maintain it at the loftiest
possible standard.</p>

<p>The subject is so vast and complicated that it is impossible,
within reasonable limits, to treat more than a portion of it
at a time.</p>

<p>London, the great metropolis, the capital of the Empire
itself, constitutes, by the number of its inhabitants, so large
a portion of the United Kingdom, that the health of its
people is a very material factor in that of the kingdom.
It has a population greater than either Scotland or Ireland,
greater than any of our Colonies, except Canada and
Australasia, greater than that of many foreign States—
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
“the greatest aggregate of human beings that has ever
existed in the history of the world in the same area of
space.”</p>

<p>And, in a measure too, it is typical of other of our great
cities.</p>

<p>A narrative of the sanitary history and conditions of life
of the people of London, therefore, would be a material
contribution to the consideration of the general subject
in its national aspect, whilst it cannot but be of special
interest to those more immediately concerned in the
amelioration of the existing condition of the masses of
the people of the great capital.</p>

<p>Such a narrative is attempted in the following pages.</p>

<p>It is, in the main, based upon the experiences, and
inferences, and conclusions, of men who, more than any
others, were in a position closely to observe the circumstances
in which the people lived, their sanitary condition,
and the causes leading thereto and influencing the same.</p>

<p>It includes the principal measures from time to time
passed by the Legislature to create local governing
authorities in sanitary matters—the various measures
designed and enacted to improve the condition of the
people—and the administration of those measures by the
local authorities charged with their administration.</p>

<p>It is a narrative, in fact, of the sanitary—and, therefore,
to a great extent of the social—evolution of this great city.</p>

<p>It is doubtful how long a time would have elapsed before
the condition of the people came into real prominence had
it not been for the oft-recurring invasions of the country by
epidemic disease of the most dreaded and fatal forms. Ever-present
diseases, disastrous and devastating though they
were, did not strike the imagination or appeal to the fears
of the public as did the sudden onslaught of an awe-inspiring
disease such as cholera.</p>

<p>An epidemic of that dreaded disease swept over London
in 1832, and there were over 10,000 cases and nearly 5,000
deaths in the districts then considered as metropolitan—the
population of those districts being close upon 1,500,000.</p>

<p>For the moment, the dread of it stimulated the people,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and such governing authorities as there were, to inspection,
and cleansings, and purifications, and to plans for vigorous
sanitary reform; but the instant the cholera departed
the good resolutions died down, and the plans disappeared
likewise.</p>

<p>There were, however, some persons upon whom this
visitation made more abiding impression; and they, struck
by the waste of human life, by the frequent recurrence of
epidemics which swept away thousands upon thousands of
victims, and distressed by the perpetual prevalence and
even more deadly destructiveness of various other diseases
among the people, bethought themselves of investigating
the actual existing facts, and the causes of them—so far
at least as London, their own city, was concerned.</p>

<p>And then slowly the curtain began to be raised on the
appalling drama of human life in London, and dimly to be
revealed the circumstances in which the great masses of the
working and labouring classes of the great metropolis lived,
moved, and came to the inevitable end, and the conditions
and surroundings of their existence.</p>

<p>The slowness with which England as a nation awoke to
the idea that the public health was a matter of any concern
whatever is most strange and remarkable. It seems now so
obvious a fact that one marvels that it did not at all times
secure for itself recognition and acknowledgment. But men
and women were growing up amidst the existing surroundings,
foul and unwholesome though those were, and some,
at least, were visibly living to old age; population was
increasing at an unprecedented rate; wealth was multiplying
and accumulating; the nation was reaching greater heights
of power and fame. What, then, was there, what could
there be wrong with the existing state of affairs?</p>

<p>Real social evils, however, sooner or later, force themselves
into prominence. For long they may be ignored,
or treated with indifference by the governing classes; for
long they may be endured by the victims in suffering and
silence; but ultimately they compel recognition, and have
to be investigated and grappled with, and, if possible,
remedied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The real beginning of such investigations was not until
near the close of the fourth decade of the nineteenth
century. Information then for the first time was collected,
of necessity very limited in extent, crude in form, and of
moderate accuracy, but none the less illuminating in its
character—information from which one can piece together
in a hazy sort of way a general impression of the condition
of the working and poorer classes in London at that
period.</p>

<p>Foremost among the diseases which worked unceasing
and deadly havoc among the people was fever. By its
wide and constant prevalence and great fatality, it was the
first upon which attention became fixed. The returns
which were collected as regarded it related to twenty
metropolitan unions or parishes, and in them only to the
pauper population, some 77,000 in number. But they
showed that in the single year of 1838, out of those 77,000
persons, 14,000, or very nearly one-fifth, had been attacked
by fever, and nearly 1,300 had died.<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Being limited to the technically pauper population this
information related only to one section of the community;
but it nevertheless afforded the means of forming a rough
estimate of the amount of fever among the community as a
whole.</p>

<p>And another fact also at once became apparent, namely,
that certain parts of London were more specially and
persistently haunted or infested by fever than others. In
Whitechapel, Holborn, Lambeth, and numerous other
parishes or districts, fever of the very worst forms was
always <span class="no-break">prevalent—“typhus,</span> and the fevers which proceed
from the malaria of filth.” The sanitary condition of
those districts was fearful, every sanitary abomination
being rampant therein, whilst certain localities in them
were so bad that “it would be utterly impossible for any
description to convey to the mind an adequate conception
of their state.” And most marvellous and deplorable of all
was the fact that this fearful condition of things was
allowed, not merely to continue, but to flourish without any
attempt being made to remedy, or even to mitigate, some of
the inevitable and most disastrous consequences.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>As regarded the districts in which the wealthier classes
resided, systematic efforts had been made on a considerable
scale to widen the streets, to remove obstructions to
the circulation of free currents of air, and to improve the
drainage—an acknowledgment and appreciation of the
fact that these things did deleteriously affect people’s
health. But nothing whatever had been attempted to
improve the condition of the districts inhabited by the
poor. Those districts were not given a thought to,
though in them annually thousands and tens of thousands
of victims suffered or died from diseases which were
preventable.</p>

<p>Reports such as these attracted some degree of attention,
and awakened a demand for further information,
and in 1840 the House of Commons appointed a Select
Committee to inquire as to the health, not only of
London, but of the large towns throughout the country.
Their report<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> enlarged upon the evils previously in part
portrayed, and emphasised them.</p>

<p>“Your Committee,” they wrote, “would pause, from the
sad statements they have been obliged to make, to observe
that it is painful to contemplate in the midst of what
appears an opulent, spirited, and flourishing community,
such a vast multitude of our poorer fellow-subjects, the
instruments by whose hands these riches were created,
condemned for no fault of their own to the evils so justly
complained of, and placed in situations where it is almost
impracticable for them to preserve health or decency of
deportment, or to keep themselves and their children from
moral and physical contamination. To require them to be
clean, sober, cheerful, contented under such circumstances
would be a vain and unreasonable expectation. There is no
building Act to enforce the dwellings of these workmen
being properly constructed; no drainage Act to enforce their
being properly drained; no general or local regulation to
enforce the commonest provisions for cleanliness and
comfort.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<p>Lurid as were the details thus made public of the condition
in which the vast masses of the people in London
were living, neither Parliament nor the Government took
any action beyond ordering successive inquiries by Poor Law
Commissioners, or Committees of the House of Commons,
or Royal Commissions.</p>

<p>Before one of these Commissions<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the following striking
evidence was given—evidence which it might reasonably
be expected would have moved any Government to immediate
<span class="no-break">action:—</span></p>

<p>“Every day’s experience convinces me,” deposed the
witness,<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> “that a very large proportion of these evils is
capable of being removed; that if proper attention were
paid to sanitary measures, the mortality of these districts
would be most materially diminished, perhaps in some places
one-third, and in others even a half.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The poorer classes in these neglected localities and
dwellings are exposed to causes of disease and death which
are peculiar to them; the operation of these peculiar causes
is steady, unceasing, sure; and the result is the same as if
twenty or thirty thousand of these people were annually
taken out of their wretched dwellings and put to death—the
actual fact being that they are allowed to remain in
them and die. I am now speaking of what silently but
surely takes place every year in the metropolis alone.”</p>

<p>But the Government took no action—beyond a Building
Act which did little as regarded the housing of the people.
No local bodies took action, and years were to pass before
either Government or Parliament stirred in the matter.</p>

<p>In dealing historically with matters relating to London
as a whole, it is to be remembered that for a long time there
had been practically two Londons—that defined and described
as the “City,” and the rest of London—that which
had no recognised boundaries, no vestige of corporate existence,
and which can best be described by the word
“metropolis.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The “City” was virtually the centre of London—the
centre of its wealth, its industry, its geographical extent—a
precisely defined area of some 720 acres, or about one
square mile in extent, and originally surrounded by walls.
Its boundaries had been fixed at an early period of our
history, and had never been extended or enlarged. So
densely was it covered with houses at the beginning of the
nineteenth century, and so fully peopled, that there was
practically no room for more, either of houses or people;
and from then to the middle of that century its population
was stationary—being close upon 128,000 at each of those
periods.</p>

<p>Apart altogether from political influences, there were in the
“City” powerful economic forces at work which profoundly
affected the condition and circumstances of the people, not
only of the “City,” but of London.</p>

<p>These, which were by no means so evident at one time,
became more and more pronounced as time went on.</p>

<p>All through the earlier part of the nineteenth century
England was attaining to world pre-eminence by her commerce,
her manufactures, and her wealth. The end of the
great war with France saw her with a firm grip of all the
commercial markets of the world. Her merchants pushed
their trade in every quarter of the globe—her ships enjoyed
almost a monopoly of the carrying trade of the world.</p>

<p>In this progress to greatness London took the foremost
part, and became the greatest port and trade emporium of
the kingdom, a great manufacturing city, and the financial
centre of the world’s trade.</p>

<p>It was upon this commerce that the prosperity and glory
of London were built: it was by this commerce that the
great bulk of the people gained their livelihood, and that a
broad highway was opened to comfort, to opulence, and
power. And so the commercial spirit—the spirit of acquiring
and accumulating wealth—got ever greater possession
of London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>That spirit had long been a great motive power in London;
it became more and more so as the century wore on, until
almost everything was subordinated to it.</p>

<p>That indisputable fact must constantly be borne in mind
as one reviews the sanitary and social condition of the people
of London at and since that time. Other constant factors
there were, also exercising vast influence—the constant
factors of human passions and human failings—but widespread
as were their effects, they were second to the all-powerful,
the all-impelling motive and unceasing desire—commercial
prosperity and success.</p>

<p>Synchronous with the rise in importance of the port of
London, and with its trade and business assuming ever
huger volume and variety, a noteworthy transformation took
place.</p>

<p>The “City,” by the very necessities of its enormous
business, became gradually more and more a city of offices
and marts, of warehouses and factories, of markets and exchanges,
and houses long used as residences were pulled
down, and larger and loftier ones erected in their place
for business purposes.</p>

<p>In some places, moreover, ground was entirely cleared of
houses for the construction of docks, or for the erection of
great railway termini.</p>

<p>How marked were the effects of these changes is evidenced
by the fact that from 17,190 inhabited houses in the “City”
in 1801, the number had sunk to 14,575 in 1851.</p>

<p>The explanation was the simple economic one, that land
in the “City” yielded a much larger income when let for
business than for residential purposes. Offices and warehouses
were absolutely essential in the “City” for business.
What did it matter if people had to look for a residence in
some other place? London was large. They could easily
find room. And the process, without control of any sort or
kind, and wholly unimpeded by legislation or governmental
regulation, went on quite naturally—entailing though it
did consequences of the very gravest character, then quite
unthought of, or, if thought of, ignored or regarded as
immaterial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>This then was, at that time, and still is, one of the
great, if not indeed the greatest of the economic forces
at work which has unceasingly dominated the housing of
the people not only in the “City,” but in the metropolis
outside and surrounding the “City,” and, in dominating their
housing, powerfully affected also their sanitary and social
condition.</p>

<p>The “City” was in the enjoyment of a powerful local
governing body—namely, the Lord Mayor and Corporation,
or Common Council, elected annually by the ratepayers;
and numerous Acts of Parliament and Royal Charters had
conferred sundry municipal powers upon them.</p>

<p>For that important branch of civic requirements—the
regulation of the thoroughfares and the construction of
houses and buildings—they had certain powers. The vastly
more important sphere of civic welfare—namely, the
matters affecting the sanitary condition of the inhabitants—was
delegated by the Corporation to a body called the
Commissioners of Sewers, annually elected by the Common
Council out of their own body, some ninety in number.
And these Commissioners had, in effect, authority in the
City, directly or indirectly, over nearly every one of the
physical conditions which were likely to affect the health
or comfort of its inhabitants. They could also appoint a
Medical Officer of Health to inform and advise them upon
public health matters, and Inspectors to enforce the laws
and regulations.</p>

<p>The “City” was thus in happy possession of a powerful
local authority, and a large system of local government.
And it stood in stately isolated grandeur, proud of, and
satisfied with, its dignity, and privileges, and wealth;
glorying in its own importance and splendour; content
with its own system of government, and its powers for
administering its municipal affairs, and indifferent to the
existence of the greater London which had grown up
around it, and which was ever becoming greater.</p>

<p>Greater indeed. The population of the “City” in 1851
was 128,000; that of the metropolis not far short of
2,500,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The number of inhabited houses in the “City” was
hundreds short of 15,000. In the metropolis it was over
300,000.</p>

<p>The “City” was 720 acres in extent: what in 1855 was
regarded as the metropolis was about 75,000 acres in
extent.</p>

<p>And here, with no visible boundary of separation between
them, were what were still “Parishes,” but what were in
reality great towns; not merely merged or rapidly merging
into each other, but already merged into one great
metropolis. Some of them even had a greater population
than the “City” itself. St. Pancras, for instance, with
167,000 persons; St. Marylebone with 157,000, and Lambeth
with 139,000.</p>

<p>Of that greater London—or, in effect, of London itself—there
is a complicated and tangled story to tell.</p>

<p>Long before the middle of the nineteenth century had
been reached, the time had passed when the “City” could
contain the trade, and commerce, and manufactures, and
business, which had grown up. They had overflowed into
London outside the walls, and just as in the “City” the
great economic forces produced certain definite changes in
the circumstances and sanitary condition of the people
living therein, so, in the greater London, the commercial
spirit radiating gradually outwards, produced precisely
similar results, only on a far wider scale, and with more
potent effect.</p>

<p>Trade, and commerce, and wealth, and population, were
increasing by leaps and bounds; and like the rings which
year by year are added to the trunk of a tree, so year by
year, decade by decade, London—the metropolis—spread
out, and grew, and grew. From something under one
million of inhabitants in 1801, the population increased to
nearly two and a half millions in 1851, partly by natural
increase, due to the number of those who were born being
greater than of those who died, partly by immigration from
the country.</p>

<p>This was London, in the large sense of the title—London,
the great metropolis which had never received recognition
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
by the law as one great entity, and whose boundaries
had never been fixed, either by enactment, charter, or
custom.<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Dependent as is the public health, or sanitary and social
condition of the people, upon the circumstances in which
they find themselves placed, and the economic forces which
are constantly at work moulding those circumstances, it is
in as great a degree dependent on the system of local
government in existence at the time, upon the scope and
efficacy of the laws entrusted to the local authorities to
administer, and upon the administration of those laws by
those authorities.</p>

<p>As for local government—unlike the “City”—this greater
London was without form and almost void. With the
exception of the Poor Law Authority—the Boards of
Guardians—whose sphere of duty was distinctly limited,
there was, outside the boundaries of the “City,” not even
the framework of a system of such government; and the
confusion and chaos became ever greater as years went on
and London grew.</p>

<p>There was no authority so important as to have any
extended area for municipal purposes under its control and
management except certain bodies, five in number, entitled
“Commissioners of Sewers,” charged with duties in
connection with the sewerage of their districts.</p>

<p>In some parishes some of the affairs of the parish were
managed by the parishioners in open vestry assembled, at
which assembly Churchwardens, Overseers of the Poor, and
Surveyors of Highways were appointed to carry out certain
limited classes of work. In others, the parishioners elected
a select vestry to do the work of the parish.</p>

<p>But for many of the vitally important municipal affairs
there were no authorities at all.</p>

<p>As the non-City and out-districts became more thickly
peopled, and streets and houses increased in number, the
inconvenience of there being practically no local government
at all made itself felt.</p>

<p>In some cases, the owners of the estates which were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
being so rapidly absorbed into London and being built
upon, applied to Parliament for powers to regulate those
estates.</p>

<p>In other cases, persons with interests in a special locality
associated themselves together and obtained a private Act
of Parliament giving them authority, under the name of
Commissioners or Trustees, to tax and in a very limited way
to govern a particular district or group of streets forming
part of a parish. Thus it happened that a large number of
petty bodies of all sorts and kinds came into existence.
Any district, however small, was suffered to obtain a local
Act of Parliament for the purpose of managing some of its
affairs, and this, too, without any reference to the interests
of the immediate neighbours, or of the metropolis as a
whole. Most of the limited and somewhat primitive
powers possessed by them were derived from an Act
passed in 1817,<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and related to the paving of streets and
the prevention of nuisances therein. Some of these bodies
were authorised to appoint surveyors or inspectors; also
“scavengers, rakers, or cleaners” to carry away filth from
streets and houses, but the exercise of such powers was, of
course, purely optional. Indeed, there were scarcely any
two parishes in London governed alike.</p>

<p>What the exact number of these various petty authorities
was is unknown. Of paving boards alone, it is said that
about the middle of the last century there were no less than
eighty-four in the metropolis—nineteen of them being in
one parish. The lighting of the parish of Lambeth was
under the charge of nine local trusts. The affairs of St.
Mary, Newington, were under the control of thirteen Boards
or trusts, in addition to two turnpike trusts.<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In <span class="no-break">Westminster:—</span></p>

<p>“The Court of Burgesses and the Vestry retained general
jurisdiction over the whole parish for certain purposes; but
the numerous local Acts so effectually subdivided the
control and distributed it among boards, commissioners,
trustees, committees, and other independent bodies, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
uniformity, efficiency, and economy in local administration
had become impossible.”<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>There were authorities exclusively for paving; authorities
for street improvements; authorities for lighting; even
authorities for a bridge across the river. In the course of
years, several hundred such bodies had been created, without
any relation one to the other, and without any central
controlling authority, good, bad, or indifferent, by as many
Acts of Parliament. They were mostly self-elected, or
elected for life, or both; and were wholly irresponsible to
the ratepayers, or indeed to any one else; nor were their
proceedings in any way open to the public. Many of them
had large staffs of well paid officials; and there were
perpetual conflicts of jurisdiction between them, and an
absolute want of anything approaching to municipal administration.</p>

<p>It has been roughly stated—roughly because there are no
reliable figures—that there were about three hundred such
bodies in London—“jostling, jarring, unscientific, cumbrous,
and costly”—the very nature of many of them being “as
little known to the rest of the community as that of the
powers of darkness.”</p>

<p>Add to these numerous, clashing, and incompetent
authorities, various great public companies or corporations—the
water companies, and gas companies, and dock
companies, each with its own special rights—which were
far more favourably and generously regarded by Parliament
than were the rights of the public, and one has fairly
enumerated the local governing bodies then existing in
London.</p>

<p>In fact, in no parish of the great metropolis of London
was there a local authority possessed of powers to deal in
its own area with the multitudinous affairs affecting the
health and well-being of the people.</p>

<p>Nor was there in the metropolis any central authority—no
single body, representative or even otherwise—to attend
to the great branches of municipal administration which
affected and concerned the metropolis as a whole, and
which could only be dealt with efficiently by the metropolis
being treated as a whole.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>The consequences to the inhabitants of London of the
absence of any efficient form of local government were dire
in character, terrible in extent, and unceasing in operation.
The higher grades of society suffered in some degree, as
disease, begotten in filth and nurtured in poverty, often
invaded with disastrous consequences the homes of the
well-to-do; but it was by the great mass of the industrial
classes and the poorer people that the terrible burden of
insanitation had to be borne, and upon them that it fell
with the deadliest effect.</p>

<p>The non-existence of a central authority, or of any capable
local authorities whose function it would have been to
protect them from the causes of disease, had resulted in an
insanitary condition which year after year entailed the
waste of thousands upon thousands of lives. And the
people, in the cruel circumstances of their position, were
absolutely powerless to help themselves, and had no possible
means of escape from the ever-present, all-surrounding
danger.</p>

<p>The first absolute necessity of any sanitation whatever is
the getting rid by deportation or destruction of all the filth
daily made or left by man or beast, for such filth or refuse
breeds all manner of disease, from the mildest up to the
very worst types and sorts, and promptly becomes not only
noxious to health, but fatal to life. The more rapidly and
thoroughly, therefore, this riddance is effected, the better is
it in every way for the general health of the public.</p>

<p>So far as the metropolis was concerned, this necessity had
for generation after generation been very lightly regarded;
and when at last it so forced itself upon public notice that
it could no longer be ignored, the measures taken were
wholly inadequate and ineffective.</p>

<p>What system there was in London as to the disposal of
sewage throughout the earlier half of last century was based
upon a Statute dating so far back as Henry VIII.’s reign,
amended by another in William and Mary’s reign. Under
these Statutes certain bodies had been constituted by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Crown as Commissioners of Sewers for certain portions of
London, and charged with the duty of providing sewers and
drains in their respective districts, and maintaining the same
in proper working order.</p>

<p>But what might have been good enough for London in
the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries was certainly not
adequate in the nineteenth, when London had extended
her borders in every direction, and her population had
reached almost two and a half millions. Successive Parliaments
had not troubled themselves about such a matter;
and this neglect, which now appears almost incredible, was
typical of the habitual attitude of the governing classes to
the sanitary requirements of the masses of the population of
the metropolis.</p>

<p>In the eighteen hundred and forties, five such bodies of
Commissioners were in existence in London, each with a
separate portion of the metropolis under its charge and
exercising an independent sway in its own district; and
when we collect the best testimony of that time as to their
work and that of their predecessors, we have the clearest
demonstration of their glaring incapacity, and of the utter
inadequacy and inefficiency of the sewerage in their
respective districts.</p>

<p>Many miles of sewers had, it is true, in process of time
been constructed, and did exist, but much of the work had
been so misdone that the cure was little better than the
disease.</p>

<p>A river is always a great temptation to persons to get rid
of things they want to get rid of, particularly when the
things are nasty and otherwise not easily disposed of.
Londoners only followed the general practice when they
constructed their sewers so that they discharged their
contents direct into the Thames. The majority of these
sewers emptied themselves only at the time of low water;
for as the tide rose the outlets of the sewers were closed,
and the sewage was dammed back and became stagnant.
When the tide had receded sufficiently to afford a vent for
the pent-up sewage, it flowed out and deposited itself along
the banks of the river, evolving gases of a foul and offensive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
character. And then the sewage was not only carried up
the river by the rising tide, but it was brought back again
into the heart of the metropolis, there to mix with each
day’s fresh supply of sewage; the result being that “the
portion of the river within the metropolitan district became
scarcely less impure and offensive than the foulest of the
sewers themselves.”</p>

<p>This was bad enough, but there were miles of sewers
which, through defects of construction or disrepair, did not
even carry off the sewage from the houses and streets to
the river, but had become “similar to elongated cesspools,”
and, as such, actual sources and creators of disease.</p>

<p>Incredible almost were the stupidities perpetrated by
these Commissioners in regard to the construction of the
sewers. At even so late a date as 1845 no survey had been
made of the metropolis for the purposes of drainage; there
was a different level in each of the districts, and no attempt
was made to conform the works of the several districts to
one general plan. Large sewers were made to discharge
into smaller sewers. Some were higher than the cesspools
which they were supposed to drain, whilst others had been
so constructed that to be of any use the sewage would have
had to flow uphill!</p>

<p>It might reasonably have been expected that in the nineteenth
century, at least, the twenty parishes which formed
the district of the Westminster Commissioners of Sewers
would have been equal to producing an enlightened and
capable body as Commissioners, but the Westminster Court
of Sewers was certainly not such. Even their own chief
surveyor, in 1847, stigmatised it as a body “totally incompetent
to manage the great and important works committed
to their care and control.”</p>

<p>Upon it were builders, surveyors, architects, and district
surveyors—a class of persons whose opinions “might certainly
be biassed with relation to particular lines of drains
and sewers.”</p>

<p>Of another of the courts—namely, the Finsbury Court
of Sewers—one of the Commission had been outlawed;
another was a bankrupt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>It was stated at the time that “jobbery and favouritism
and incompetence were rampant,” and that the system was
“radically wrong and rotten to the core.” Certain it is that
these bodies failed completely to cope with the requirements
of the time. London was spreading out in all directions,
and the increase of houses and population was very rapid.
Practically no effort, however—certainly no adequate effort—was
made by the various bodies of Commissioners to provide
these new and growing districts with the means of getting
rid of their sewage. And then, inasmuch as the sewage had
somehow or other to be got rid of, and some substitute for
sewers devised, the surface drains, and millstreams, and
ditches were appropriated to use and converted into open
sewers or “stagnant ponds of pestilential sewage.”</p>

<p>London was “seamed with open ditches.”</p>

<p>According to contemporary reports there were in Lambeth
numerous open ditches of the most horrible description.
Bermondsey was intersected by ditches of a similar character,
and abounded with fever nests. Rotherhithe was
the same. Hackney Brook, formerly “a pure stream,” had
become “a foul open sewer.”<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In St. Saviour’s Union the
sewers were in a dreadful condition … “the receptacle of
all kinds of refuse, such as putrid fish, dead dogs, cats, &amp;c.
Greenwich was not drained or sewered.”</p>

<p>What certainly was conclusively demonstrated was that
the existence of several bodies of Commissioners, each with
a district to itself, presented an insuperable obstacle to any
general system of sewerage for greater London; and that
one capable central authority was the first essential of an
adequate and efficient system for London as a whole.</p>

<p>Thus, then, in this first essential of all sanitation—one
might say of civilisation—no adequate provision was made
by Parliament for the safety of the metropolis; whilst as to
other essentials of sanitation, there were no laws for the
prevention of the perpetration of every sanitary iniquity;
and such authorities as there were failed absolutely to use
even the few powers they possessed.</p>

<p>The defective and inefficient sewerage of the metropolis
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
precluded the possibility of any proper system of house
drainage, for there being few sewers there were few drains,
and consequently instead of drains from the houses to the
sewers there were cesspools under almost every house. At
the census of 1841 there were over 270,000 houses in the
metropolis. It was known, then, that most houses had a
cesspool under them, and that a large number had two,
three, or four under them. Some of them were so huge
that the only name considered adequate to describe them
was “cess-lake.” In many districts even the houses in
which the better classes lived had neither drain nor sewer—nothing
but cesspools; and many of the very best portions
of the West End were “literally honeycombed” with them.
And so jealous was the law as regarded the rights of private
property that so late as 1845 owners were not to be interfered
with as regarded even their cesspools, no matter how
great the nuisance might be to their neighbours, no matter
how dangerous to the community at large. Indeed, the
Commissioners of Sewers had no power to compel landlords
or house-owners to make drains into the sewers, and of
their own motion the landlords would take no action.</p>

<p>In the lower part of Westminster the Commissioners of
Sewers had actually carried sewers along some of the streets,
but they found “very little desire on the part of the
landlords” to use them. “So long as the owners get their
rent they do not care about drainage…. The landlords
will not move; their property pays them very well; they
will not put themselves to any expense; they are satisfied
with it as it stands.”</p>

<p>Strange level of satisfaction! when one reads the
following evidence given two years later before the
Metropolitan Sewers <span class="no-break">Commission:—</span></p>

<p>“There are hundreds, I may say thousands, of houses in
this metropolis which have <em>no drainage whatever</em>, and the
greater part of them have stinking, overflowing cesspools.
And there are also hundreds of streets, courts, and alleys,
that have no sewers; and how the drainage and filth is
cleared away, and how the poor miserable inhabitants live
in such places it is hard to tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“In pursuance of my duties, from time to time, I have
visited very many places where filth was lying scattered
about the rooms, vaults, cellars, areas, and yards, so thick,
and so deep, that it was hardly possible to move for it. I
have also seen in such places human beings living and
sleeping in sunk rooms with filth from overflowing cesspools
exuding through and running down the walls and over the
floors…. The effects of the stench, effluvia, and poisonous
gases constantly evolving from these foul accumulations
were apparent in the haggard, wan, and swarthy countenances,
and enfeebled limbs, of the poor creatures whom
I found residing over and amongst these dens of pollution
and wretchedness.”<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>And this witness was unable to refrain from passing a
verdict upon what he had <span class="no-break">seen:—</span></p>

<p>“To allow such a state of things to exist is a blot
upon this scientific and enlightened age, an age, too, teeming
with so much wealth, refinement, and benevolence.
Morality, and the whole economy of domestic existence,
is outraged and deranged by so much suffering and misery.
Let not, therefore, the morality, the health, the comfort of
thousands of our fellow creatures in this metropolis be in
the hands of those who care not about these things, but let
good and wholesome laws be enacted to compel houses to
be kept in a cleanly and healthy condition.”</p>

<p>There were, it was said, “a formidable host of difficulties”
as regarded the execution of improved works of
house drainage.</p>

<p>There was the opposition of the proprietors on the
ground of expense; there were the provisions of the Act of
Parliament,<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which were so intricate as to be almost
unintelligible and unworkable; there was the want of
a proper outfall for the sewage; and the want of a supply
of water to wash away the filth—a possible explanation for
the existing state of abomination, but certainly not a
justification for the prolonged inaction of successive
Parliaments and Governments in allowing affairs to reach
so frightful a pass, and for dooming the people to a
condition of things which it was entirely beyond their
power to remedy even as regarded the single house they
inhabited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as everything connected with sewerage and drainage
was so placidly neglected, and so fearfully bad, so also was
it as regarded another matter of even more vital necessity,
namely, the supply of water to the inhabitants of
London for drinking, or for domestic, trade, or sanitary
purposes.</p>

<p>“Water is essential as an article of food. Water is
necessary to personal cleanliness. Water is essential to
external cleansing, whether of houses, streets, closets, or
sewers.”</p>

<p>Manifestly, the supply of water was not a matter which
the individual in a large community such as London could
in any way make provision for by his own independent
effort. And yet there was no public body in London,
central or local, representative or otherwise, charged with
the duty of securing to the people even the minimum
quantity necessary for life.</p>

<p>Early in the seventeenth century the New River Company
was formed for the supply of water to London. And as
years went on Parliament evidently considered it fulfilled
its obligations in this respect by making over to sundry
private companies the right of supplying to the citizens of
London this vital requirement, or, as it has been termed,
this “life-blood of cities”; and Parliament had done this
without even taking any guarantee or security for a proper
distribution to the people, or for the purity of the water, or
the sufficiency of its supply.</p>

<p>Practically, a generous Parliament had bestowed as a
free gift upon these Water Companies the valuable monopoly,
so far as London was concerned, of this necessity
of life.</p>

<p>Although by the middle of the nineteenth century there
was no portion of the metropolis into which the mains and
pipes of some of the companies had not been carried, yet,
as the companies were under no compulsion to supply it to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
all houses, large numbers of houses, and particularly those
of the poorer classes, received no supply. Indeed, in many
parts of London there were whole streets in which not a
single house had water laid on to the premises.</p>

<p>In the district supplied by the New River Company,
containing about 900,000 persons, about one-third of the
population were unsupplied; and in the very much smaller
area of the Southwark Company’s district about 30,000
persons had no supply.</p>

<p>Even in 1850 it was computed that 80,000 houses in
London, inhabited by 640,000 persons, were unsupplied
with water.</p>

<p>A very large proportion of the people could only obtain
water from stand-pipes erected in the courts or places, and
that only at intermittent periods, and for a very short time
in the day; sometimes, indeed, only on alternate days, and
not at all on Sunday.</p>

<p>“To these pipes,” wrote a contemporary, “the inhabitants
have to run, leaving their occupation, and collecting
their share of this indispensable commodity in vessels of
whatever kind might be at hand. The water is then kept
in the close, ill-ventilated tenements they occupy until it is
required for use.”<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The quality of the water which was supplied by the companies
left much to be desired. That supplied by the New
River Company was, as a rule, fairly good in quality; but
that supplied by the other companies was very much the
reverse. Financial profit being their first and principal
consideration, they got it from where it was obtainable at
least capital outlay or cost, regardless of purity or impurity;
and almost without exception took it from the Thames—“the
great sewer of London”—took it, too, from precisely
the places where the river was foulest and most contaminated
by sewage and other filth; and as there were no
filtering beds in which it could have been to some extent
purified before its distribution to householders, its composition
can best be imagined.</p>

<p>Looking at the great river even now in its purified state,
as it sweeps under Westminster Bridge, any one would
shudder at the idea of being compelled to drink its water
in its muddy and unfiltered state, and of one’s health and
life being dependent on the supply from such a source.
How infinitely more repugnant it must have been when
the river was “the great sewer” of the metropolis.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>The great shortage of company-supplied water compelled
large numbers of people to have recourse to the pumps
which still existed in considerable numbers in many parts
of London, the water from which was drawn from shallow
wells.</p>

<p>The water of these “slaughter wells,” as they have
been termed, appears to have combined all the worst
features of water, and to have contained all the ingredients
most dangerous to health.</p>

<p>“If,” wrote a Medical Officer of Health some years later,
“the soil through which the rain passes be composed of the
refuse of centuries, if it be riddled with cesspools and the
remains of cesspools, with leaky gas-pipes and porous
sewers, if it has been the depository of the dead for generation
after generation, the soil so polluted cannot yield water
of any degree of purity.”<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>As all these “ifs” were grim actualities, the water of such
wells was revolting in its impurity and deadly in its composition.</p>

<p>Of Clerkenwell it was indeed stated positively that “the
shallow-well water of the parish received the drainage
water of Highgate cemetery, of numerous burial grounds,
and of the innumerable cesspools in the district.”</p>

<p>On the south side of the river the water in most of the
shallow wells was tidal—from the Thames, which is a
sufficient description of the quality thereof—and where
people did not live close enough to the river to draw water
from it for their daily wants, they took it from these tidal
wells. Vile as it was, it had to be used in default of any
better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Where such wells were not available, the water for all
household consumption was taken from tidal ditches which
were to all intents and purposes only open sewers. A contemporary
report gives a graphic picture of this form of
supply<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><span class="no-break">:—</span></p>

<p>“In Jacob’s Island (in Bermondsey) may be seen at any
time of the day women dipping water, with pails attached
by ropes to the backs of the houses, from a foul, fœtid ditch,
its banks coated with a compound of mud and filth, and
with offal and carrion—the water to be used for every purpose,
culinary ones not excepted.”</p>

<p>An adequate supply of wholesome water has for very long
been recognised as of primary sanitary importance to all
populations, but with a densely crowded town population
the need of care as to the quality of the supplies is peculiarly
urgent. And yet, through the indifference of successive
Governments, the people of the great metropolis of London
were most inadequately supplied with water, and what water
was supplied to the great mass of them, or was available for
them, was of the foulest and most dangerous description.
The inadequacy of supply not alone put a constant premium
upon dirt and uncleanliness, both in house and person, but
it intensified the evils of the existing sewers and drains, as
without water efficient drainage was impossible. And
the horrible impurity of the water affected disastrously
and continuously the health of the great mass of the
people.</p>

<p>Many dire lessons, costing thousands upon thousands of
lives, were needed before it was borne in on the Government
of the country that the arrangements regarding the supply
of water for the people of London required radical amendment.</p>

<p>Much of the health of a city depends upon the width of
its thoroughfares, the free circulation of air in its streets
and around its buildings, and the sound and sanitary construction
of its houses.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>In every one of these respects all the central parts of
London were remarkably defective. The great metropolis
had grown, and had been permitted to grow, mostly at
haphazard. Large parks and open spaces there were in the
richer and more well-to-do parts, and some handsome
thoroughfares; but “there were districts in London
through which no great thoroughfares passed, and which
were wholly occupied by a dense population composed of
the lowest class of persons, who, being entirely secluded
from the observation and influence of better educated
neighbours, exhibited a state of moral degradation deeply
to be deplored.”<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Parliament had taken some interest as to the width of
the streets, and had shown some anxiety for improvements
in them. Hence, much local and general legislation was
from time to time directed to control the erection of buildings
beyond the regular lines of buildings. Thus the Metropolitan
Paving Act, 1817, contained stringent provisions
as to projections which might obstruct the circulation
of air and light, or be inconvenient or incommodious to
passengers along carriage or foot ways in certain parts of
the metropolis.</p>

<p>In 1828 the Act for Consolidating the Metropolis Turnpike
Trusts, also, contained certain restrictive provisions, but
these were rendered futile by the construction put upon its
terms by the magistrates.</p>

<p>Again, in 1844, further enactments were made by the
Metropolitan Building Act to restrain projections from
buildings; but after a short administration of its provisions
it was found that shops built on the gardens in front of the
houses, or on the forecourts of areas, did not come within
the terms of the Act. And so the Act, in that very important
respect, was useless.</p>

<p>The action of Parliament had been mainly prompted by
the necessity for increased facilities of communication, and
by the desire to safeguard house property from destruction
by fire; whilst the most important of all aspects of the
housing of the people—namely, the sanitary aspect—received
no consideration, and was completely ignored as
a thing of no consequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>But whatever the motive of action by Parliament, the
ensuing legislation was in the main inoperative or ineffective.
The resolution of landowners to secure the highest
prices for their property, and the determination of builders,
once they got possession of any land, to utilise every inch of
it for building, and so to make the utmost money they could
out of it, defeated the somewhat loosely drawn enactments.
Means of evading the legislative provisions were promptly
discovered, and, in despite of legislation, builders, architects,
and surveyors of the metropolis were unrestrained in their
encroachments upon areas and forecourts—at times even
were successful in breaking the existing lines of buildings in
metropolitan streets or roads by encroachments which were
only discovered too late to be prevented.</p>

<p>Nor was there anything to prevent houses being built on
uncovered spaces at the backs of existing buildings, thus
taking up whatever air-space had been left between the
previous buildings. Hence, great blocks of ground absolutely
covered with buildings, back to back, side to side,
any way so long as a building could by any ingenuity be
fitted in. Hence the culs-de-sac, the small and stifling
courts and alleys. Nor were there any regulations forbidding
certain kinds of buildings which would be injurious
to the health of their inhabitants. Hence the mean and
flimsy and insanitary houses which were being erected in
the outer circle of the metropolis, and which wrought havoc
with the health and lives of the people. Hence, too, the
erection, on areas and forecourts, of buildings which
narrowed the streets, diminished the air-spaces and means
of ventilation, and destroyed the appearance of the localities.</p>

<p>And once up they had come to stay; for years were to
pass before the Legislature created any effective means for
securing their amelioration, and for generations they were
permitted to exercise their evil and deadly sway over the
people, and to scatter broadcast throughout the community
the seeds of disease and death.</p>

<p>The then existing actual state of the case was summed
up by Dr. Southwood Smith in his evidence before the
Select Committee of the House of Commons in <span class="no-break">1840:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“At present no more regard is paid in the construction
of houses to the health of the inhabitants than is paid to
the health of pigs in making sties for them. In point of
fact there is not so much attention paid to it.”</p>

<p>Legislation against some of the evils which had already
reached huge proportions, and which, as London grew,
were spreading and developing, was not alone ineffective,
but earlier legislation, in one notorious Act, had been the
direct incentive to, and cause of evils. This was the Act
which imposed a tax upon windows.<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In effect this Act
said to the builder, “Plan your houses with as few openings
as possible. Let every house be ill-ventilated by shutting
out the light and air, and as a reward for your ingenuity
you shall be subject to a less amount of taxation.”<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The builder acted upon this counsel, and the tax operated
as a premium upon the omission from a building of every
window which could by any device be spared; with the
result that passages, closets, cellars, and roofs—the very
places where mephitic vapours were most apt to lodge—were
left almost entirely without ventilation.<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>In effect, the window duties compelled multitudes to live
and breathe in darkened rooms and poisoned air, and with
a rapidly increasing population the evils resulting therefrom
were being steadily intensified.</p>

<p>Admirable was the comment passed upon the tax in
<span class="no-break">1843:—</span></p>

<p>“Health is the capital of the working man, and nothing
can justify a tax affecting the health of the people, and
especially of the labouring community, whose bodily health
and strength constitute their wealth, and, oftentimes, their
only possession. It is a tax upon light and air, a tax more
vicious in principle and more injurious in its practical consequences
than a tax upon food.”</p>

<p>Not until 1851 was the tax abandoned, but its evil consequences,
wrought in stone and embodied in bricks and
mortar, endured many a long year after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The existing laws or regulations as to building were
wholly inadequate to secure healthy houses. And there
was no public authority with power to compel attention to
the internal condition of houses so as to prevent their continuance
in such a filthy and unwholesome state as to endanger
the health of the public. There was no power to
compel house owners to make drains and carry them to the
common sewer where it existed. No persons were appointed
to carry into effect such communication. No persons were
authorised to make inspection and to report upon these
matters.</p>

<p>The poor, or, indeed, the working classes generally, were
powerless to alter or amend the construction of the dwellings
in which they were compelled to reside, still less to alter
their surroundings. Any improvement in the condition of
their dwellings could only be by voluntary action on the
part of the landlords, or of interference by Government to
compel that measure of justice to the poor, and of economy
to the ratepayers.</p>

<p>Parliament failed to interfere with any effect; and as to
the landlords or house-owners, their interest ran all the
other way.</p>

<p>Few persons of large capital built houses as a speculation,
or had anything to do with them. Many, however, who
were desirous of making the highest possible interest on
their money acquired either freehold or leasehold land, and
built cheap and ill-constructed houses upon it without the
least regard to the health of the future inmates.</p>

<p>And the small landlords were often the most unscrupulous
with regard to the condition of the houses they let, and
exacted the highest rents.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as this freedom as regarded house construction
had been going on almost from time immemorial, it was not
only the newly-built houses which were bad. Earlier built
houses had rapidly fallen into disrepair and semi-ruin, and
were steadily going from bad to worse, and becoming ever
less and less suitable for human dwellings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The following description<a id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of parts of St. Giles’ and
Spitalfields shows what, under a state of freedom as to
building, had been attained to in 1840, and is typical of
what so extensively prevailed in the central parts of
<span class="no-break">London:—</span></p>

<p>“Those districts are composed almost entirely of small
courts, very small and very narrow, the access to them
being only under gateways; in many cases they have been
larger courts originally, and afterwards built in again with
houses back to back, without any outlet behind, and only
consisting of two rooms, and almost a ladder for a staircase;
and those houses are occupied by an immense number of
inhabitants; they are all as dark as possible, and as filthy
as it is possible for any place to be, arising from want of
air and light.”</p>

<p>Here is another description—that of “Christopher
Court,” a cul-de-sac in Whitechapel—given, in 1848, by
Dr. Allison, one of the surgeons of the <span class="no-break">Union:—</span></p>

<p>“This was one of the dirtiest places which human
beings ever visited—the horrible stench which polluted
the place seemed to be closed in hermetically among the
people; not a breath of fresh air reached them—all was
abominable.”</p>

<p>It is needless to multiply instances. There is a dreadful
unanimity of testimony from all parts of London as to the
miserable character and condition of the houses in which in
the middle of the nineteenth century the industrial and the
lower classes were forced to live; the deficiency or total
absence of drainage, the universal filth and abomination of
every kind, the fearful overcrowding, the ravages of every
type of disease, and the absolute misery in which masses
struggled for existence.</p>

<p>The density of houses upon an area has long been recognised
as one of the great contributing causes to the ill-health
of a community, but when coupled with the
overcrowding of human beings in those houses, the combined
results are always disastrous in the extreme.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>Overcrowding had been a long-standing evil in London;
had existed far back in history.</p>

<p>As London had grown, the evil had grown; and about
the middle of the last century it was immeasurably greater
than ever before, and its disastrous consequences were on
a vastly larger scale.</p>

<p>The great economic forces which resulted, in certain
districts of London, in the destruction of houses and great
clearances of ground, had largely reduced the available
accommodation for dwellings, and the expelled inhabitants,
chained to the locality by the fact of their livelihood being
dependent upon their residence being close by, were forced
to invade the yet remaining places in the neighbourhood
suited to their means. As the circle of possible habitations
contracted, while the numbers seeking accommodation
therein increased, a larger population was crowded into an
ever-diminishing number of houses.</p>

<p>It was also a most unfortunate but apparently inevitable
consequence that once a beginning was made to improve
some of the streets and thoroughfares of London, and to
substitute in any district a better class of houses and shops
for those actually existing, the improvements necessarily
involved increased overcrowding in that particular locality
and in those adjoining it. But so it was.</p>

<p>Thus, in the eighteen hundred and forties a new street—New
Oxford Street—was formed. It was driven through
“a hive of human beings, a locality overflowing with human
life.” Evidence given before the Commission in 1847
described the <span class="no-break">results:—</span></p>

<p>“The effect has been to lessen the population of my
neighbourhood by about 5,000 people, and therefore to
improve it at the expense of other parts of London. Some
have gone to the streets leading to Drury Lane, some to
St. Luke’s, Whitechapel, but more to St. Marylebone and
St. Pancras. The vestries of St. Marylebone and St. Pancras
disliked this very much. Places in the two latter
parishes which were before bad enough are now intolerable,
owing to the number of poor who formerly lived in
St. Giles’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>And a year or so later, from across the river, came the
complaint from Lambeth that “owing to the number of
houses pulled down in Westminster and other places, there
had been a great influx of Irish and other labourers which
necessarily caused a great overcrowding of the miserable
domiciles already overfull.”</p>

<p>This Lambeth complaint is specially interesting, as it
refers to another great cause of overcrowding—the constant
immigration into London of labourers and poor people
in search of work or food.</p>

<p>Owing to the ever increasing and urgent demand for
house accommodation for the working and poorer classes,
it became a very remunerative proceeding for the occupier
of a house to sub-let it in portions to separate families or
individuals, and the practice gradually extended to and
absorbed streets hitherto belonging to the better class.
The owner of a property let his whole house to a tenant;
this tenant, seeing an easy way of making money, sub-let
the rooms in it in twos or threes, or even separately, at a
very profitable rate to individual tenants. Nor did the
sub-letting end here, for these tenants let off even the sides
or corners of their room or rooms to individuals or families
who were unable to bear the expense of a whole room.
And so the house sank at once into being a “tenement
house”—that prolific source of the very worst evils,
sanitary, physical, and moral, to those who inhabited
them.</p>

<p>Even the underground kitchens and cellars, which were
never intended for human habitation, were let to tenants,
and thus turned to financial profit.<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It mattered not that
they were without air or ventilation, or even light; it
mattered not that they were damp, or sometimes even
inundated with the overflow of cesspools; it mattered
not that they were inhabited contrary to the provisions
of Section 53 of the Building Act of 1844, for that section
was of no operative effect whatever. It is true that “Overseers”
were to report to the “Official Referees,” who were
to give notice to and inform the owners and occupiers of
such dwellings as to the consequences of disobeying the
Statute, and the “District Surveyor” was to carry out the
directions of the Referees. But nothing was ever done—Overseers,
District Surveyors, and Referees, all neglected
their duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Overcrowding was usually at its worst in one-room
tenements, and in an immense number of cases in the
metropolis one room served for a family of the working
or of the labouring classes. It was their bedroom, their
kitchen, their wash-house, their sitting-room, their eating-room,
and, when they did not follow any occupation elsewhere,
it was their workroom and their shop. In this one
room they were born, and lived, and slept, and died amidst
the other inmates.</p>

<p>And still worse, in innumerable cases, more than one
family lived in one room.</p>

<p>When this one room was in a badly drained, damp, ill-constructed,
and unventilated house, reeking with a polluted
atmosphere, and that house was in a narrow and hemmed-in,
unventilated “court” or “place” or “alley”—as an
immense number of them were—the maximum of evil
consequences was attained.</p>

<p>The evils of overcrowding cannot be summed up in a
phrase, nor be realised by the description, however graphic,
of instance upon instance. The consequences to the individual
living in an overcrowded room or dwelling were
always disastrous, and, through the disastrous consequences
to great masses of individuals, the whole community was
affected in varying degree.</p>

<p>Physically, mentally, and morally, the overcrowded people
suffered. Not a disease, not a human ill which flesh is heir
to, but was nurtured and rendered more potent in the human
hothouse of the overcrowded room; and the ensuing ill-health
and diseases not alone doubled the death rate, but
increased from ten to twenty-fold, at least, the number of
victims of disease of one sort or another—diseases dealing
rapid death, or slowly but surely sapping human strength
and vitality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>In the report of the London Fever Hospital for 1845
a certain overcrowded room in the neighbourhood was
described—a room which was filled to excess every night,
sometimes from 90 to 100 men being in it; a room 33 feet
long, 20 feet wide, and 7 feet high. From that one room
alone no fewer than 130 persons affected with fever were
received into the hospital in the course of the year.<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>One, whose very close experience of the conditions of life
and circumstances of the poorer classes of London at the
time of the cholera epidemic of 1848–9 entitled him to speak
with special authority on the subject, thus summed up his
views and <span class="no-break">conclusions:—</span></p>

<p>“The members of the medical profession, in the presence
of these physical evils, when they are, as so often happens,
concentrated, find their science all but powerless; the
minister of religion turns from these densely crowded and
foul localities almost without hope; whilst the administrators
of the law, especially the chaplains and governors
of prisons, see that crime of every complexion is most rife
where material degradation is most profound.”<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>And he quoted from the report of the Governors of the
Houses of Correction at Coldbath Fields and Westminster
the following <span class="no-break">passage:—</span></p>

<p>“The crowning cause of crime in the metropolis is, in my
opinion, to be found in the shocking state of the habitations
of the poor, their confined and fœtid localities, and the consequent
necessity for consigning children to the streets for
requisite air and exercise. These causes combine to produce
a state of frightful demoralisation. The absence of cleanliness,
of decency, of all decorum—the disregard of any
needful separation of the sexes—the polluting language and
the scenes of profligacy hourly occurring, all tend to foster
idleness and vicious abandonment. Here I beg emphatically
to record my conviction that this constitutes the
<em>monster mischief</em>.”</p>

<p>And then he himself <span class="no-break">adds:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“If to considerations like these regarding the moral and
religious aspect of this great question, be added those suggested
by the indescribable physical sufferings inflicted on
the labouring classes by the existing state of the public
health in the metropolis, the conviction must of necessity
follow, that the time is come when efforts in some degree
commensurate with these great and pervading evils can no
longer with safety be deferred.”<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>This opinion was expressed three years after the Royal
Commissioners of 1847 had said in their <span class="no-break">report:—</span></p>

<p>“There appears to be no available (legal) means for the
immediate prevention of overcrowding; all we can do is
to point it out as a source of evil to be dealt with hereafter.”</p>

<p>One gets a clue to the unceasing insanitary condition of
the greater part of London and to the inhuman conduct of
so many tenement house-owners when one realises that
there was no legal punishment whatever for the perpetration
and perpetuation of the insanitary abominations, no
matter how noxious or dangerous they were, nor how
rapidly or directly they led to disease or death. An order
to abate a nuisance (which usually was not obeyed) appears
to have been the only penalty, and it was only obtainable at
great trouble and after great delays; and, even if obtained
and the nuisance abated, there was nothing to prevent the
offender at once starting the nuisance again. Offences of
the most heinous description—amounting morally to deliberate
murder—were perpetrated with absolute impunity.
Houses which were scarcely ever free from fever cases were
allowed to continue year after year levying their heavy death
tax from the unfortunate inhabitants.</p>

<p>In Whitechapel one house, inhabited by twelve or fourteen
families, was mentioned as scarcely free from fever cases for
as many years.</p>

<p>“It is also a fearful fact that in almost every instance
where patients die from fever, or are removed to the hospital
or workhouse, their rooms are let as soon as possible to new
tenants, and no precautions used, or warning given; and in
some houses, perfect hotbeds of fever probably, where a
patient dies or is removed, the first new-comer is put into
the sick man’s bed.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>Sanitary improvement was almost a hopeless task.
There was a dead weight of opposition to it in the ignorance
and recklessness and indifference of the poorer
classes, the very hopelessness of being able to improve
their condition. And there was an active and bitter
opposition from those house-owners or lessees who for
their own financial profit exploited the poorer classes.</p>

<p>“There is one house in Spitalfields,” said Dr. Lynch,
“which has been the constant habitation of fever for fifteen
years. I have enforced upon the landlord the necessity of
cleansing and lime-washing it, but it has never been done!!…
There are many landlords with whom nothing but
immediate interest has any effect.”<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The favourite principle that an Englishman’s house was
his castle was used as a defence against any suggestion
that the malpractices committed therein should be curbed.</p>

<p>Others argued, “I am entitled to do what I like with
my own.”</p>

<p>“We everywhere find people ready to declare in respect
to every evil: There is not any law that could compel
its removal, the place complained of being private property.”</p>

<p>All sorts of far-fetched and strained arguments were
devised by them in the efforts to evade responsibility for
the infamous condition of their property, and to defend
and justify inaction.</p>

<p>Fortunately some voices began to be raised as to the
persons upon whom both equitably and morally the
responsibility lay of improving the condition of things.</p>

<p>“I would suggest,” said a voice in 1837, “the idea of the
landlords of many of the wretched filthy tenements being
held responsible for their being tenantable, healthy, and
cleanly.”</p>

<p>And the Commissioners in 1844 <span class="no-break">reported:—</span></p>

<p>“There are some points on which the public safety
demands the exercise of a power on the part of a public
authority to compel attention to the internal condition of
houses so as to prevent their continuance in such a filthy
and unwholesome state as to endanger the health of the
public.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>And they recommended <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>“On complaint of the parish, medical, or other authorised
officer, that any house or premises are in such a filthy and
unwholesome state as to endanger the health of the public,
the local authority have power to require the landlord to
cleanse it properly without delay.”</p>

<p>But ideas or recommendations were alike ignored by the
Government and Parliament, and several years were to pass
before any legislation was attempted which would make
owners responsible for their misdeeds in matters affecting
the public health, and would subject them to penalties
for their misconduct.</p>

<p>There were many other causes contributing largely to the
insanitary condition of the people of the metropolis, prominent,
if not most deleterious, amongst them being the
widely-prevalent practice of interring the dead in the
already overcrowded churchyards or burial grounds in the
midst of the most densely populated districts of London—a
practice resulting in “the slaughter of the living by the
dead.”</p>

<p>Burial grounds long since utilised to their utmost for the
disposal of the dead were utilised over and over again for
graves which could only be dug in the débris of human
remains, until the soil reeked with human decomposition;
the surrounding atmosphere was polluted by the horrible
process, and they became monstrous foci of infection.</p>

<p>How extensive this evil was may be realised from
figures given by Mr. Chadwick in a report to the
<span class="no-break">Government:—</span></p>

<p>“In the metropolis, on spaces of ground which do not
exceed 203 acres, closely surrounded by the abodes of the
living, layer upon layer, each consisting of a population
numerically equivalent to a large army of 20,000 adults,
and nearly 30,000 youths and children, is every year imperfectly
interred. Within the period of the existence of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the present generation upwards of a million of dead must
have been interred in those same spaces.”</p>

<p>And he asserted <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>“The emanations from human remains are of a nature
to produce fatal disease, and to depress the general health
of whoever is exposed to them; and interments in the
vaults of churches, or in graveyards surrounded by inhabited
houses, contribute to the mass of atmospheric and other
impurities by which the general health and average duration
of life of the inhabitants is diminished.”</p>

<p>Too horribly gruesome and revolting are the descriptions of
these graveyards—places where the dead were, so to speak,
shovelled in as the filth of the streets is into scavengers’
carts, and which “gave forth the mephitical effluvia of
death”; such a one as that in Russell Court, off Drury
Lane, where the whole ground, which by constant burials
had been raised several feet, was “a mass of corruption”
which polluted the air the living had to breathe, and
poisoned the well water which in default of other they
often had to drink. Or those in Rotherhithe, where “the
interments were so numerous that the half-decomposed
organic matter was often thrown up to make way for
fresh graves, exposing sights disgusting, and emitting foul
effluvia.”</p>

<p>The master hand of Dickens has given a more vivid
picture of one of these places than any to be found in
Parliamentary Blue <span class="no-break">Books:—</span></p>

<p>“A hemmed-in churchyard, pestiferous and obscene,
whence malignant diseases are communicated to the bodies
of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed….
Into a beastly scrap of ground, which a Turk would reject
as a savage abomination, and a Caffre would shudder at,
they bring our dear brother here departed to receive
Christian burial. With houses looking on on every side,
save where a reeking little tunnel of a court gives access to
the iron gate—with every villainy of life in action close on
death, and every poisonous element of death in action close
on life—here they lower our dear brother down a foot or
two; here sow him in corruption, to be raised in corruption;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
an avenging ghost at many a sick bedside; a shameful
testimony to future ages, how civilisation and barbarism
walked this boastful island together.”</p>

<p>Interments in the vaults of the churches—then a common
practice—were also a fruitful source of sickness and death.
It mattered not whether or not the bodies were hermetically
closed in leaden coffins, for “sooner or later every corpse
buried in the vault of a church spreads the products of
decomposition through the air which is breathed, as readily
as if it had never been enclosed”; thus adding to the
contamination of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The death-roll from this horrible condition of things
cannot be gauged, but those most conversant with the
matter were firmly convinced that it was the direct cause of
fevers, and of all kinds of sickness among the people.</p>

<p>Pollution of the atmosphere which people had to breathe,
and upon the purity of which the public health in varying
degree depended, was caused also by various businesses and
processes of manufacture grouped together under the
name of “noxious trades,” such as bone-boilers, india-rubber
manufacturers, gut-scrapers, manure manufacturers,
slaughterers of cattle, and many others.</p>

<p>In 1849<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> a description had been given of a street in
Shoreditch which shows to what extent this evil had
<span class="no-break">attained:—</span></p>

<p>“It is impossible to believe, passing through this main
street, that so great a number of pigsties, bone-boileries,
dog-and-cat’s meat manufactories, and tallow-melting establishments,
on a large scale … should exist in a densely-crowded
and closely-built locality. The noxious trades and
occupations which so greatly abound here exerted a most
deleterious influence upon the health of the inhabitants.”</p>

<p>Parliament, in 1844, had enacted with regard to several
of these that it should not be lawful for any person to
establish any such business at a less distance than 40 feet
from the public way, or than 50 feet from any dwelling-house;
and that it should not be lawful to erect a dwelling-house
within 50 feet of such businesses.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>But these legislative restraints were utterly inadequate as
any sort of check upon the evil; for, even if a nuisance
were abated, there was no law to prevent its repetition, and
so the evil promptly re-appeared. The stenches did not
limit their sphere of action by feet, but distributed their
abominations over large areas; and the manufacturers cared
not what nuisances they subjected people to, nor how far
the horrid smells were wafted by the winds, so long as they
themselves could carry on a profitable business. And the
intentions of Parliament were wholly frustrated by the
District Surveyors, who were charged with the enforcement
of the Act, and who wholly failed in their duty.</p>

<p>As for slaughter houses, until 1851 any person could
start one who pleased, and practically where he pleased,
subject only to the shadowy restriction of the common law
as to doing anything which might be considered a nuisance.</p>

<p>And so these numerous and various abominations, mixed
with the impurity of the atmosphere caused by the masses
of smoke emitted from the chimneys of factories and
private houses, and with the sickening smell from the
Thames, spread sickness and death throughout great
portions of the metropolis, and were one of the great
causes of its insanitary condition.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h3><br />II</h3>

<p>Previous to the fifth decade of the last century it was
only very rarely that the prevalence of disease, or any
subject connected with the health of the community,
received recognition by Parliament.</p>

<p>In 1840 the Medical Society of London, in a petition to
Parliament, called attention to the increase of smallpox,
and to its preventability by vaccination, and to the imperfect
means of vaccination throughout the country.</p>

<p>The mortality from this—“one of the greatest pests that
ever afflicted humanity”<a id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>—was very great. In one city in
the south of England no less than 500 persons had died of
it in one year. In London in 1839 upwards of 1,000 had
died of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>And Parliament, after an unusual amount of discussion,
passed an Act<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> for extending the practice of vaccination,
and enacted that Boards of Guardians might contract with
their Medical Officers or other medical practitioners “for
the vaccination of all persons resident in their Union
or Parish.”</p>

<p>And at the same time “inoculation” or “otherwise producing
smallpox” was made penal—to the extent of one
month’s imprisonment.</p>

<p>In 1846 there was a sudden display of Parliamentary
energy in health matters.</p>

<p>The total want of baths and wash-houses for the poorer
classes of the people in the towns was brought under the
notice of the Legislature, and, as it was deemed “desirable
for the health, comfort, and welfare of the inhabitants of
towns, &amp;c., to encourage the establishment therein of
baths, wash-houses, and open bathing places,” an Act
was passed giving power to the Parochial Authorities to
establish such institutions and to borrow money for the
purpose.<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Their provision would have tended to an increased degree
of cleanliness among the people, and consequently an
improved sanitary condition, but it was long before many
of these institutions were established, the local authorities
being slow in availing themselves of the facilities thus
offered, and this piece of legislation—like every other of
the sort—being purely permissive or facilitatory.</p>

<p>And in the same year Parliament so far awakened to the
fact that certain causes of disease were removable, that in a
preamble to an Act<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> it acknowledged that it was “highly
expedient for the purposes of preserving the health of Her
Majesty’s subjects that better provision should be made
for the removal of certain nuisances likely to promote or
increase disease.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The better provision made by the Act did not amount to
much. There were two forms of insanitary evil to be combated:
one the chronic insanitary condition of the masses of
the people, the other the invasion of the country by some
exceptional or unusual epidemic disease.</p>

<p>As to the former, authority was given to certain public
officers, on receipt of a certificate of two medical men, to
complain of the existence of certain nuisances. The Justices
before whom the case was heard might order the abatement
of the nuisance; and if the order were not obeyed, the
parties complaining might enter upon the necessary cleansing
of such dwelling, and the cost of the same might be
imposed on the owner or occupier.</p>

<p>In London, the power of complaint was vested in the
officers of those petty local bodies which have already been
described, and, in their default, in the Boards of Guardians.</p>

<p>Ludicrous, truly, was the idea that the countless thousands
of nuisances existing in London could be remedied, or even
temporarily abated, by so cumbrous, dilatory, and complicated
a procedure as the complaint of an individual
backed by the certificate (which would have to be paid for)
of two doctors to the officer of a more or less hostile and
self-interested local body, who might or might not bring the
complaint before the Justices, whose decision, even if it
were in favour of the complainant, could only effect a
reform so far as the precise nuisance complained of was
concerned, and that only temporarily, for were the nuisance
renewed the whole procedure would have to be gone through
again.</p>

<p>Yet this was the “better provision” propounded and
enacted by Parliament in 1846 for the regeneration of the
sanitary condition of the great masses of the people of
London. Nor was it even intended to be permanently
available, for the Act was only to be in force for two
years.</p>

<p>The dreadful nemesis for such dense inappreciation by
Parliament of its obligations to the community was, unfortunately,
soon to fall heavily upon the unhappy people of
the metropolis. Thousands of miles away in Hindoostan,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Asiatic cholera of a deadly type had been playing havoc
with the people of the country. Thence it was slowly but
steadily moving westward; so much so that the desirability
of making some preparations for defence against its invasion
of England became apparent; and in 1847 a Royal Commission
was appointed to “inquire whether any, and what,
special means might be requisite for the improvement of the
health of the metropolis, with regard more especially to the
better house, street, and land drainage, … the better
supply of water for domestic use, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<p>One important conclusion was at once forced upon the
Commissioners, namely, that the great and vital task of
making adequate provision for the sewerage of London could
not be accomplished so long as it was entrusted to several
bodies, each with a district of its own.</p>

<p>“Everything,” they said, “pointed to the necessity of
operations being superintended by one competent body”;
and they declared that it was expedient that a Commission
for the entire drainage of the whole of the metropolis should
be appointed with a special view to such measures, and
with aid to carry them out.</p>

<p>This report was followed in the ensuing year (1848) by an
Act of Parliament<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> abolishing the various Commissions of
Sewers (except those of the City), and creating in their
stead one executive body whose members were to be appointed
by the Crown.</p>

<p>Wide powers were given to this central body: among
them that no house was to be built or re-built without
proper drains, and without proper sanitary conveniences,
and that if houses built before the passing of the Act were
not properly drained, the Commissioners might order the
work to be done.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers were duly
appointed, and they divided the area over which they had
jurisdiction into seven separate sub-districts, with a Commission
for each.</p>

<p>The creation of this body constitutes a great landmark in
the sanitary evolution of London, for it was the first recognition
by Parliament of the great principle of the unity
of London; of the necessity—at least so far as regarded
one matter—for one central governing authority for the
numerous populations, and bodies, and districts which were
becoming welded together into one mighty town and one
vast community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true, the recognition extended only to this one
matter, and that the Central Board was to be a Board
nominated by the Crown, and without any vestige of representation
upon it, but none the less it was a forward step
towards a sounder and wiser system of government than
that which had hitherto prevailed.</p>

<p>That the new body failed to prove equal to the task
imposed upon it was due as well to the constituent members
thereof as to the imperfections of the machinery devised by
the Act. Its failure, however, in no way controverted the
soundness of the great principle thus, for the first time,
recognised by Parliament.</p>

<p>The evidence given before the Royal Commissioners
brought into view the enormous area of filth and limitless
insanitation in London: it displayed some of the principal
sources of the excessive amount of disease and premature
mortality; and to some extent it elucidated the principles
and demonstrated the practicability of large measures of
prevention. And it also disclosed the regrettable fact that
since the epidemic of cholera in 1832 there had been little
or no improvement in the sanitary condition of many parts
of the metropolis—indeed, in most parts of it the evils were
wider spread and acuter in form, whilst, owing to the increase
of population, the numbers affected were vastly larger.</p>

<p>All the while the Commissioners were sitting, the evil
seeds of insanitation were producing a tremendous crop,
and events actually occurring at the moment emphasised
the crying need for some means of grappling with the intolerable
existing evils. The whole class of zymotic diseases—diseases
which constitute the true gauge of the healthiness
or unhealthiness of a community—received a rapid and
immense development.<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> From 9,600 deaths from such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>diseases in 1846, the number increased to 14,000 in 1847;
and in this latter year the metropolis was visited by two
epidemics which rendered the mortality of the last quarter
of the year higher than that of any other quarter of any
year since the new system of registration of deaths had been
commenced.<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Typhus fever produced fourfold its ordinary
mortality—other diseases showed a similar increase—and
towards the end of November influenza broke out and spread
so suddenly and to such an extent that within five or six
weeks it attacked no less than 500,000 persons out of
2,100,000—the then population of London. Altogether the
excess of mortality in 1847 over 1845 was very close upon
50,000 persons.</p>

<p>The attitude of Parliament and of successive Governments
about this period, as regarded the insanitary condition of the
masses of the inhabitants of London, is now almost incomprehensible.
The plea of ignorance cannot be urged in
exculpation, for their own Blue Books and official returns
were there to inform them. Moreover, the existence of
similar evils throughout the country, where they were on a
very much smaller scale, was recognised both by the
Government and Parliament.</p>

<p>Lord Morpeth, a member of the Cabinet, speaking in
1848 in the House of Commons, said<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a><span class="no-break">:—</span></p>

<p>“It is far from any temporary evil, any transient visitant,
against which our legislation is now called upon to provide.
It is the abiding host of disease, the endemic and not the
epidemic pestilence, the permanent overhanging mist of
infection, the annual slaughter doubling in its ravages our
bloodiest fields of conflict, that we are now summoned to
grapple with.”</p>

<p>Yet they resolutely shut their eyes to the huge mass of
misery and fearful waste of life which was going on at their
very doors, and all around them. This was proved beyond
controversy by their action in 1848. In that year the
Government introduced into Parliament a measure which
was, in effect, a comprehensive sanitary code, and which, if
duly enforced, was capable of conferring vast benefit on the
community at large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Describing the provisions of the Bill, Lord Morpeth
<span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“It will be imperative upon the local administrative
bodies to hold meetings for the transaction of business; to
appoint a surveyor; to appoint an inspector of nuisances;
to make public sewers; to substitute sufficient sewers in
case old ones be discontinued; to require owners or
occupiers to provide house-drains; to cleanse and water
streets; to appoint or contract with scavengers to cleanse,
cover, or fill up offensive ditches; … to provide sufficient
supply of water for drainage, public and private, and for
domestic use.</p>

<p>“The permissive powers to be granted to the local administrative
bodies … include the power to make house-drains
upon default of owner or occupier, to make bye-laws
with respect to the removal of filth, to whitewash and purify
houses after notice … to require that certain furnaces be
made to consume their own smoke … to provide places
for public recreation, to purchase and maintain waterworks.”</p>

<p>The Bill, which was duly passed and became an Act, in
fact provided means for coping with many of the sorest
dangers, it curbed some of the powers for evil which so
many persons had such little scruple in exercising; it
provided methods for bringing to punishment at least some
of the evil-doers who hitherto had gone scot free; and it
held out some prospects of the diminution of the huge
death rate and still huger sick rate.</p>

<p>Though a somewhat similar Bill, introduced in 1847, and
which was withdrawn, had included the metropolis, this
Act did not apply to the metropolis. Its application was
limited to the rest of England and Wales. London—the
capital of the kingdom—was, it was said, “reserved for a
separate Bill.” “The separate Bill,” however, did not
make its appearance. The subtle, all-pervading influence
of vested rights was too powerful for any such reform to be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
attempted.<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And so, the Government and Parliament,
deliberately excluding the metropolis from this beneficial
legislation, left untouched the centre and main emporium of
disease, and left the people of London exposed on all sides
to the merciless onslaught of the direst diseases which can
afflict mankind.</p>

<p>Cholera, however, the only power able to awe the
Government, was now so close at hand that some special
provision had to be devised for the protection of the public
health. Parliament, this time not excluding the metropolis,
re-enacted the trumpery “Nuisance Removal and
Diseases Prevention Act” of 1846, with some slight enlargements,
and one important addition, namely, authority for
the appointment by the Privy Council of a General
Board of Health, which might issue directions and regulations
for the prevention of epidemic and contagious
disease.</p>

<p>Upon this slender thread Londoners were left dependent
for such measures as might afford them some protection
against the impending epidemic. No other help was at
hand. Nor was there much time for help to be organised
or preparations made, for cholera had reached Egypt and
Constantinople, and by June, 1848, had crept forward to
St. Petersburg. Isolated suspicious cases occurred in
London in the summer of 1848,<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> then an undoubted case
in Southwark on the 22nd of September, and then more
undoubted cases, and the disease had secured a footing.
As the winter approached it died down and ceased, having
carried off some 468 victims.</p>

<p>The Privy Council had appointed a General Board of
Health, and early in November the Board issued regulations
directing the Guardians to take the necessary
measures for the cleansing of houses, the abatement of
nuisances, and generally for the removal of all matters
injurious to health. To direct is one thing, to get obeyed is
another, and with some few exceptions, these directions
were disregarded. Partly, the fault was Parliament’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The Act, by naming various local authorities, had created
a divided power, and consequently a divided responsibility,
which resulted in inaction, neglect, delay, and loss of life;
and though the General Board of Health might require the
Boards of Guardians and other local bodies to put the
regulations into force, they had no power to compel them
to do so, and in default of such power the General Board of
Health was almost helpless.</p>

<p>The cessation of the disease proved to be only temporary.
Scarcely was 1849 entered on than the epidemic broke
out again, steadily gathering momentum as the summer
went on.</p>

<p>In Bethnal Green there was an outbreak in the night—sudden
and panic-striking—“consternation and alarm were
spread abroad—the hurried passing and re-passing of
messengers, and the wailing of relatives, filled the streets
with confusion and woe, and impressed all with a deep sense
of awful calamity.”</p>

<p>And the epidemic spread and spread until in one week in
September (1849) the deaths from it amounted to 2,026.<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Were the full facts known, the mortality was doubtless
far higher.</p>

<p>And then the epidemic began rapidly to abate, and by the
end of the year had ceased, having slain some 14,600 victims.<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Numerous and important were the lessons inculcated by
this disastrous epidemic. It afforded the most definite
evidence that had yet been obtained of the influence upon
health of local conditions and pre-disposing causes.</p>

<p>It showed that in the most violent and extensive outbreaks
of the pestilence its virulence was invariably confined
to circumscribed localities. It showed that the habitat of
cholera and the habitat of fever were one and the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Deaths from cholera took place in the very same streets,
and houses, and rooms, which had been again and again
visited by fever; and rooms were pointed out where some
of the poor people had recovered from fever in the spring to
fall victims to cholera in the summer.</p>

<p>As it was tersely summed up by one of the most active
and capable medical officers of the Board of <span class="no-break">Health:—</span></p>

<p>“We find but one cause of so much sickness, suffering
and death—the prolific parent of all this diversified offspring—‘filth.’</p>

<p>“It is in filth, in decomposing organic matter, that the
main causes of epidemic diseases are to be sought out—filthy
alleys, filthy houses, filthy air, filthy water, and filthy
persons.”</p>

<p>What the General Board of Health could do, it did, as
was indeed to be expected from such sanitary enthusiasts
as Lord Ashley, Dr. Southwood Smith, and Mr. Edwin
Chadwick, but the local authorities were dilatory, lukewarm,
or actually hostile, and their proceedings, where anything
was done, were altogether inadequate for insuring those
prompt, comprehensive, and vigorous measures so urgently
demanded in the presence of a great and destructive
epidemic such as malignant cholera.</p>

<p>The system of house-to-house visitation was essential
for the discovery and checking of the disease, but, wrote
the Board, “nothing effective was done or attempted in
the metropolis. We repeatedly and earnestly urged upon
the Boards of Guardians the importance to the saving
of life of making immediate arrangements for special
measures of prevention, but our representations were made
in vain.</p>

<p>“The local authorities could not be induced to carry into
effect the preventive measures we proposed.”</p>

<p>Several unions and parishes, among whom were some of
the most wealthy and populous, positively refused to comply
with the directions of the Board.</p>

<p>In the case of Bethnal Green, just described, the Board
issued a “Special Order.” But even under these urgent
circumstances “the Board of Guardians appointed no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
medical officer for five days, they provided no nurses, they
established no hospital, they opened no dispensary, they
appointed one inspector of nuisances instead of two, and
they made no provision for extensive and effectual lime-washing.”</p>

<p>The explanation of the inaction and hostility of the local
authorities lay in the fact that the various measures prescribed
by the Act interfered with private interests, and
especially with interests which were largely represented on
the Boards of Guardians. Among the members of those
boards there was often “an antagonistic power” at work
which prevented proper attention being paid to the sanitary
condition of the localities of the poor. In many instances,
owners of small houses and cottage property, to which class
of dwellings the provisions of the Act more particularly
applied, were themselves members of such boards, and
when this was not the case, they exerted an influence not
the less powerful because it was indirect. This interest
often conspired to impede efficient sanitary measures.<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Local interests also operated, the apprehension being that
if active and really efficient measures were adopted the trade
of the neighbourhood would suffer.</p>

<p>In one instance—an instructive one—where the epidemic
had extensively prevailed among the poor, its existence was
denied, and house-visitation resisted, till, after considerable
delay and loss of life, a number of shopkeepers were attacked
by the disease, and <em>then</em>, all opposition ceased.</p>

<p>The evidence of the unfitness of the local authorities
charged with the administration of the Act for the duties
imposed upon them was overwhelming. The unfortunate
position was accentuated and intensified by the fact that
the General Board of Health had no power either of compelling
the local authorities to do their duty or of itself
acting in default of their neglect; and the absence of this
first essential of effective administration hampered and
crippled its action.</p>

<p>The Board summed up its experience of this great visitation
of 1848–9<span class="no-break">:—</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p>“The evidence shows that where combined sanitary
arrangements have been carried into effect the outbreak of
the pestilence has been sometimes averted; that where not
prevented, its course has been gradually arrested.</p>

<p>“That where material improvements have been made in
the condition of the dwellings of the labouring classes, there
has been an entire exemption from the disease, and where
minor improvements were made, the attacks have been less
severe and less extensive.</p>

<p>“That with reference to the measure of prevention, the
immunity from the disease has been in proportion to the
extent to which those measures have been carried into effect
systematically and promptly.”</p>

<p>By the end of the year the epidemic was practically over.
And then the usual thing took place.</p>

<p>It is described a few months later by Dr. Grainger, who
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“In many of the most densely populated districts the
inspectors of nuisances have been dismissed, the cleansing
operations have been relaxed, and there is too much reason
to apprehend that the courts and alleys will lapse back again
into their accustomed filth, … that houses proved by the
evidence of medical officers, inspectors, and local authorities
to be unfit for human habitation will long continue to
remain ‘pest-houses,’ spreading disease around; and that,
in the midst of these tolerated and accumulated evils,
the industrious classes will continue as heretofore to
be decimated by fever, or, should it again break out, by
cholera.”<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h3><br />III</h3>

<p>The “City” of London, though constituting territorially
and by population but a small portion of the metropolis,
affords much matter of deep interest in connection with the
sanitary evolution of London, totally apart from those great
economic forces emanating from it which have dominated
the whole of London life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p>The “City” differed mainly, as has already been pointed
out, from “greater London” in that it had a real and active
governing body for its local affairs, and that that body was
possessed of considerable powers for dealing with the
sanitary condition and requirements of its inhabitants.
That those sanitary powers were annually delegated to a
body entitled the Commissioners of Sewers in no way
diminished its sanitary authority or weakened its efficiency,
for that body was practically a Committee of its own, and
had authority, directly or indirectly, over nearly every one
of the physical conditions which were likely to affect the
health or comfort of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>The “City” differed also in that it was able to obtain
from the Government and Parliament powers which neither
Government nor Parliament would grant to “greater
London.”</p>

<p>It differed too in that from 1848 onwards it was in beneficial
enjoyment of the services of a Medical Officer of
Health.</p>

<p>But in many respects the “City” was a microcosm of the
metropolis; and though possessed of a local government,
yet was it cursed with evils which were the terrible legacy
left it by the ignorance, indifference, neglect, incapacity, or
cupidity, of previous generations.</p>

<p>The graphic reports of its Medical Officer of Health—Dr.
John Simon—have left us a most vivid and valuable
contemporary picture of the sanitary condition and surroundings
of the people living in the favoured area
about the middle of the last century, and they disclose,
in no hesitating manner, the desperate evils prevalent
therein.</p>

<p>The Thames, “with the immeasurable filth” which
polluted it, and its acres of mud banks saturated with the
reeking sewage of an immense population, vitiated the
atmosphere of the City, just as it did that of other parts of
London. But sewers there were in the City, of one sort or
another, over forty miles of them, and some of the filth of
the City was carried away, at least into the river.</p>

<p>House drainage into the sewers was, however, either
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
lamentably deficient or non-existent, and cesspools abounded—abounded
so freely that “parts of the City might be
described as having a cesspool-city excavated beneath it.”</p>

<p>“It requires,” reported Dr. Simon to his employers,
“little medical knowledge to understand that animals will
scarcely thrive in an atmosphere of their own decomposing
excrements; yet such, strictly and literally speaking, is the
air which a very large proportion of the inhabitants of the
City are condemned to breathe…. In some instances,
where the basement storey of a house is tenanted, the cesspool
lies, perhaps merely boarded over, close beneath the
feet of a family of human beings whom it surrounds uninterruptedly,
whether they wake or sleep, with its fœtid pollution
and poison.”</p>

<p>For such evils, and such a state of things, he said, house
drainage, with effective water supply, were the remedies
which could alone avail; and it was only in the Session of
1848 that the authority to secure and enforce these remedies
was vested by the Legislature in any public body whatsoever.
The City was fortunately included, but the metropolis,
with its two and a half millions of inhabitants, was unfortunately
not.</p>

<p>The unrestricted supply of water, he pointed out, was the
first essential of decency, of comfort, and of health; no
civilisation of the poorer classes could exist without it; and
any limitation to its use in the metropolis was a barrier
which must maintain thousands in a state of the most
unwholesome filth and degradation.</p>

<p>Even in the City, however, the supply of water was but
“a fraction of what it should have been, and thousands
of the population inhabited houses which had no supply
of it.”</p>

<p>Nor was what was supplied by the Water Companies
much to boast of.</p>

<p>“The waters were conducted from their sources in open
channels; they received in a large measure the surface-washing,
the drainage, and even the sewage of the country
through which they passed; they derived casual impurities
from bathers and barges, and on their arrival were, after a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
short subsidence in reservoirs, distributed without filtration
to the public.”</p>

<p>In some cases the scanty distribution was from a stand-pipe
in a court or alley, for a very short time of the day. In
other cases the water was delivered into butts or cisterns.
Their condition is thus <span class="no-break">described:—</span></p>

<p>“In inspecting the courts and alleys of the ‘City,’” he
wrote, “one constantly sees butts, for the reception of water,
either public or in the open yards of houses, or sometimes
in their cellars; and these butts, dirty, mouldering, and
coverless; receiving soot and all other impurities from the
air; absorbing stench from the adjacent cesspool; inviting
filth from insects, vermin, sparrows, cats, and children;
their contents often augmented through a rain-water pipe
by the washings of the roof, and every hour becoming
fustier and more offensive. Nothing can be less like
what water should be than the fluid obtained under such
circumstances.”</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that the evils of the system
of water supply by private companies were, even in the
“City,” so manifest that Dr. Simon expressed his opinion
that the only satisfactory solution of the difficulty in
connection therewith was the acquisition by the public
authority of the control of the supply, and he urged the
adoption of the principle of what is now denounced by
some people as “municipal trading.”</p>

<p>In every practical sense the sale of water in London
was a monopoly.</p>

<p>“The individual customer,” wrote Dr. Simon, “who is
dissatisfied with his bargain can go to no other market;
and however legitimate may be his claim to be supplied
with this prime necessary of life at its cheapest rate, in
the most efficient manner, and of the best possible quality,
your Honourable Court (the Commissioners of Sewers)
hitherto possesses no power to enforce it.”</p>

<p>In the Public Health Act of 1848 the principle had
been recognised by Parliament so far as towns in the
country were concerned—local Boards of Health being
authorised to provide their district with such a supply of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
water as might be proper or sufficient, or to contract for
such a supply. He urged that the City should obtain a
similar power.</p>

<p>“All the advantages which could possibly be gained by
competition, together with many benefits which no competition
could ensure, would thus be realised to the population
under your charge.”</p>

<p>But that solution of the difficulty was more than half a
century in advance of its accomplishment so far as either
the “City” or “greater London” was concerned.</p>

<p>As to the atmosphere in the “City,” there seems to
have been no limit to the pollutions thereof, all of which
were injurious to the health of the public.</p>

<p>Numerous noxious and offensive trades were carried on
in the most crowded places.</p>

<p>Directly and indirectly, slaughtering of animals in the
“City” was prejudicial to the health of the population,
and exercised a most injurious influence upon the district.</p>

<p>The number of slaughter-houses registered and tolerated
in the “City” in 1848 amounted to 138, and of these, in
58 cases, the slaughtering was carried out in the vaults
and cellars.<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>And there were very many noxious and offensive trades
in close dependence upon “the original nuisance” of the
slaughter-house, and round about it, “the concomitant and
still more grievous nuisances of gut-spinning, tripe-dressing,
bone-boiling, tallow-melting, paunch-cooking, &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<p>Certain it is that offensive businesses of these and other
sorts were carried on by their owners with an absolute
disregard to the comfort or health of the public.</p>

<p>The matter was a difficult one to deal with, as any
severe restrictions might destroy the trade or manufacture
and take away from the people the employment which
gave them the means of earning a livelihood. Furthermore,
such restrictions were usually resented as an infraction
of personal liberty. Dr. Simon forcibly and
conclusively answered this contention.</p>

<p>“It might,” he wrote, “be an infraction of personal
liberty to interfere with a proprietor’s right to make
offensive smells within the limits of his own tenement,
and for his own separate inhalation, but surely it is a still
greater infraction of personal liberty when the proprietor,
entitled as he is to but the joint use of an atmosphere
which is the common property of his neighbourhood,
assumes what is equivalent to a sole possession of it, and
claims the right of diffusing through it some nauseous
effluvium which others, equally with himself, are thus
obliged to inhale.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>Some improvement in this respect was rendered possible
by the Act of 1851, which enacted that whatever trade or
business might occasion noxious or offensive effluvia, or
otherwise annoy the inhabitants of its neighbourhood,
“shall” be required to employ the best known means for
preventing or counteracting such annoyance.</p>

<p>But the remedy scarcely appears to have been availed of
or enforced, and “greater London” was, as usual, excluded
from the Act.</p>

<p>Another more constant pollution of the air was that
resulting from intramural burial. “Overcrowding” in the
“City” was not limited to the living; it extended even to
the dead, and though the dead themselves had passed
beyond any further possible harm from it, yet their overcrowding
affected disastrously those they had left behind.
Here the evils already described as existing in “greater
London” existed also in acute form. Two thousand bodies
or more were interred each year actually within the “City”
area, and the burial grounds were densely packed. And
“in all the larger parochial burying grounds, and in most
others, the soil was saturated with animal matter undergoing
slow decomposition.”</p>

<p>And the vaults beneath the churches were “in many
instances similarly overloaded with materials of putrefaction,
and the atmosphere which should have been kept
pure and without admixture for the living, was hourly
tainted with the fœtid emanations of the dead….”</p>

<p>In Dr. Simon’s <span class="no-break">words:—</span></p>

<p>“Close beneath the feet of those who attend the services
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of their church there often lies an almost solid pile of
decomposing human remains, heaped as high as the
vaulting will permit, and generally but very partially
coffined.”</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Burials Act of 1852 effected a great
improvement in this respect by putting a term to the
indefinite perpetuation of this horrible evil. It gave the
Secretary of State power to prohibit further intramural
burials, and it gave the “City,” and other local authorities,
the power to establish burial places beyond the boundaries
of the metropolis. But, even when thus stopped, years
had to elapse before the condition of intramural burial
grounds and vaults would cease to vitiate the air around
them.<a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The atmosphere of the “City,” the air which people
breathed, was thus vitiated in varying degrees of intensity
by numerous and various abominations—the polluted
Thames, defective sewerage and drainage, offensive trades,
intramural interments.</p>

<p>As regards the houses in which the people lived, these
were crammed together—packed as closely together as
builders’ ingenuity could pack them—many of them combining
every defect that houses could have, and so situated
that ventilation was an impossibility.</p>

<p>“In very many parts of the City you find a number of
courts, probably with very narrow inlets, diverging from
the open street in such close succession that their backs
adjoin, with no intermediate space whatsoever. Consequently
each row of houses has but a single row of windows
facing the confined court, and thus there is no possibility of
ventilation, either through the court generally or through
the houses which compose it…. Houses so constructed
as to be as perfectly a cul-de-sac out of the court as the
court is a cul-de-sac out of the street.”<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>And the climax of insanitary conditions was reached
when these densely-packed houses were overcrowded by
human beings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The process of converting dwelling-houses into warehouses,
or business offices, or for trade or manufactures was
in full swing—a constant force—and so the number of
houses for people to live in became ever fewer.</p>

<p>And the “tenement houses,” in which the great bulk
of the working classes lived, became more and more
crowded; houses wherein “each holding or tenement,
though very often consisting but of a single small
room, receives its inmates without available restriction
as to their sex or number, and without registration of
the accommodation requisite for cleanliness, decency, and
health.”</p>

<p>The Census of 1851 had shown an increase of over 4,200
in the population of the “City,” and a diminution of nearly
900 houses.</p>

<p>“Probably,” wrote Dr. Simon, “for the most part it
represents the continued influx of a poor population into
localities undesirable for residence, and implies that habitations
previously unwholesome by their overcrowdedness
are now still more densely thronged by a squalid and sickly
population….</p>

<p>“It is no uncommon thing, in a room twelve feet
square or less, to find three or four families styed together
(perhaps with infectious disease among them), filling the
same space night and day—men, women, and children, in
the promiscuous intercourse of cattle. Of these inmates
it is nearly superfluous to observe that in all offices of
nature they are gregarious and public; that every instinct
of personal or sexual decency is stifled; that every nakedness
of life is uncovered there…. Who can wonder at
what becomes, physically and morally, of infants begotten
and born in these bestial crowds?…”</p>

<p>Of overcrowding or “pestilential heaping of human
beings,” this matter of “infinite importance,” he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“While it maintains physical filth that is indescribable,
while it perpetuates fever and the allied disorders, while it
creates mortality enough to mask the results of all your
sanitary progress, its moral consequences are too dreadful
to be detailed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Pursuing his masterly analysis of the sanitary condition
of the people in the “City” and its causes, he
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Last and not least among the influences prejudicial to
health in the City, as elsewhere, must be reckoned the
social condition of the working classes…. Often in discussion
of sanitary subjects before your Honourable Court,
the filthy, or slovenly, or improvident, or destructive, or
intemperate, or dishonest habits of these classes are cited as
an explanation of the inefficiency of measures designed for
their advantage. It is constantly urged that to bring improved
domestic arrangements within the reach of such
persons is a waste and a folly.</p>

<p>“It is unquestionable that in houses containing all the
sanitary evils enumerated—undrained and waterless, and
unventilated—there do dwell whole hordes of persons
who struggle so little in self-defence against that which
surrounds them that they may be considered almost
indifferent to its existence, or almost acclimated to endure
its continuance.</p>

<p>“It is too true that among the lower classes there are
swarms of men and women who have yet to learn that
human beings should dwell differently from cattle—swarms
to whom personal cleanliness is utterly unknown; swarms
by whom delicacy and decency in their social relations are
quite unconceived.</p>

<p>“My sphere of duty lies within the City boundary.</p>

<p>“I studiously refrain from instituting comparisons with
other metropolitan localities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“I feel the deepest conviction that no sanitary system
can be adequate to the requirements of the time, or can
cure those radical evils which infest the under framework of
society, unless the importance be distinctly recognised and
the duty manfully undertaken of improving the social condition
of the poor….</p>

<p>“Who can wonder that the laws of society should at
times be forgotten by those whom the eye of society
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
habitually overlooks, and whom the heart of society often
appears to discard?</p>

<p>“To my duty it alone belongs, in such respects, to tell
you where disease ravages the people under your charge, and
wherefore; but while I lift the curtain to show you this—a
curtain which propriety may gladly leave unraised—you
cannot but see that side by side with pestilence there stalks
a deadlier presence, blighting the moral existence of a rising
population, rendering their hearts hopeless, their acts
ruffianly and incestuous, and scattering, while Society
averts her eyes, the retributive seeds of increase for crime,
turbulence, and pauperism.”</p>

<p>And what was the physical result of this state of
living?</p>

<p>“In some spots in the City you would see houses, courts,
and streets, where the habitual proportion of deaths is far
beyond the heaviest pestilence rate known for any metropolitan
district aggregately—localities where the habitual
rate of death is more appalling than any such averages can
enable you to conceive.</p>

<p>“Among their dense population it is rare to see any other
appearance than that of squalid sickness and misery, and
the children who are reproduced with the fertility of a
rabbit warren perish in early infancy.</p>

<p>“The diseases of these localities are well marked.
Scrofula more or less completely blights all that are born
… often prolonging itself as a hereditary curse in the
misbegotten offspring of those who, under such unnatural
conditions, attain to maturity and procreation.</p>

<p>“Typhus prevails as a habitual pestilence.</p>

<p>“The death rate during the last five years has been at
the rate of about twenty-four per 1,000 per annum.</p>

<p>“The City of London appears peculiarly fatal to infant
life.</p>

<p>“Of the 15,597 persons who died within your jurisdiction
in the five years 1847–8 to 1852–3, nearly three-eighths died
in the first five years of life.”</p>

<p>To his employers he mostly appeals. He hopes that the
statements in his reports may suffice to convince them of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the necessity which exists in the “City” of London for some
effectual and permanent sanitary organisation.</p>

<p>“For the metropolis generally there is hitherto no
sanitary law such as you possess for your territory.”</p>

<p>He pointed out <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“Inspection of the most constant, most searching, most
intelligent, and most trustworthy kind is that in which the
provisional management of our said affairs must essentially
consist.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The committee was given power by the Act for the
amendment or removal of houses presenting aggravated
structural faults.</p>

<p>“Wherever your Medical Officer of Health may certify to
you that any house or building is permanently unwholesome
and unfit for human habitation, you are empowered to
require of the owner (or in his neglect yourselves to undertake)
the execution of whatever works may be requisite for
rendering the house habitable with security to life.”</p>

<p>And he urged <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>“The principle might be distinctly recognised that the
City will not tolerate within its municipal jurisdiction the
continuance of houses absolutely incompatible with healthy
habitation.</p>

<p>“Here terminates my statement of the powers now vested
in you for the maintenance of the public health.</p>

<p>“Authority so complete for this noble purpose has never
before been delegated to any municipal body in the
country.</p>

<p>“If the deliberate promises of Science be not an empty
delusion, it is practicable to reduce human mortality
within your jurisdiction to nearly the half of the present
prevalence.”</p>

<p>The most valuable and weighty of all his conclusions was
that affixing the responsibility for the existing mass of
insanitation and consequent misery. With a courage
worthy of all admiration he did not hesitate, regardless
of the consequences to himself, to fix the responsibility
and blame where they were due.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“The fact is that, except against wilful violence, life is
very little cared for by the law.”</p>

<p>Of Parliament he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Fragments of legislation there are, indeed, in all
directions; enough to establish precedents, enough to
testify some half-conscious possession of a principle; but
for usefulness little beyond this. The statutes tell that
now and then there has reached to high places the wail
of physical suffering. They tell that our law makers, to
the tether of a very scanty knowledge, have, not unwillingly,
moved to the redress of some clamorous wrong…. But
… their insufficiencies constitute a national scandal, …
something not far removed from a national sin….</p>

<p>“The landlord must be held responsible for the decent
and wholesome condition of his property, and for such
conduct of his tenants as will maintain that condition.”</p>

<p>The clear, precise, and unqualified enunciation of such
a principle must have given a shock to many of the
members of the governing authority of the “City,” and
excited their wrath, the more especially as it was so
absolutely sound and true.</p>

<p>“The death of a child by smallpox,” he went on to say,
“would in most instances call for a verdict of ‘homicide by
omission’ against the parent who had neglected daily
opportunities of giving it immunity from that disease by
the simple process of vaccination; the death of an adult
by typhus would commonly justify still stronger condemnation
(though with more difficulty of fixing and proportioning
the particular responsibility) against those who ignore the
duties of property, and who knowingly let for the occupation
of the poor dwellings unfit even for brute tenants, dwellings
absolutely incompatible with health.”</p>

<p>And then he proceeds to explain and justify and enlarge
upon his assertion of the responsibility of the landlord.</p>

<p>“There are forty-five miles of sewerage in your jurisdiction,
ready to receive the streams of private drainage, and
leaving the owners of house property no excuse for the
non-performance of necessary works…. But … the
intentions of your Court, and the industry of its officers,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
have been in great measure frustrated by the passive
resistance of landlords. Delays and subterfuges have been
had recourse to in order to avoid compliance with the
injunctions of the Commission.”</p>

<p>In his evidence before the Royal Commission of 1853–4
he <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“The poorer house property of the City is very often in
the hands of wealthy people who have only the most general
notion of its whereabouts, have perhaps never visited the
place for which they receive rent, and in short know their
property only through their agents.</p>

<p>“Instances have come to my knowledge of the very worst
description of property being thus held ignorantly and carelessly
by wealthy persons. Often for years we can get at
no representative of the property other than the agent or
collector who receives the weekly rent for some anonymous
employer.”</p>

<p>In his third Report to the Commissioners of Sewers he
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“It is easy to foresee the numerous obstacles which
interested persons will set before you to delay the accomplishment
of your great task.</p>

<p>“When your orders are addressed to some owner of
objectionable property—of some property which is a
constant source of nuisance, or disease, or death; when
you would force one person to refrain from tainting
the general atmosphere with results of an offensive
occupation; when you would oblige another to see that
his tenantry are better housed than cattle, and that, while
he takes rent for lodging, he shall not give fever as an
equivalent—amid these proceedings you will be reminded
of the ‘rights of property’ and of ‘an Englishman’s inviolable
claim to do as he will with his own.’</p>

<p>“Permit me to remind you that your law makes full
recognition of these principles and that the cases in which
sophistical appeal will often be made to them are exactly
those which are most completely condemned by a full and
fair application of the principles adverted to. With private
affairs you interfere only when they become of public
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
import, with private liberty only when it becomes a public
encroachment. The factory chimney that eclipses the
light of heaven with unbroken clouds of smoke, the melting
house that nauseates an entire parish, the slaughter-house
that forms round itself a circle of dangerous disease—these
surely are not private but <em>public</em> affairs.</p>

<p>“And how much more justly may the neighbour appeal
to you against each such nuisance as an interference with
his privacy; against the smoke, the stink, the fever that
bursts through each inlet of his dwelling, intrudes on him
at every hour, disturbs the enjoyment and shortens the
duration of his life. And for the rights of property—they
are not only pecuniary. Life, too, is a great property, and
your Act (of 1851) asserts its rights.”</p>

<p>“The landlord of some overthronged lodging-house complains
that to reduce the number of his tenantry, to lay
on water, to erect privies, or to execute some other indispensable
sanitary work, would diminish his rental—in
the spirit of your Act it is held a sufficient reply that
human life is at stake—and that a landlord in his dealings
with the ignorant and indefensive poor cannot be suffered
to estimate them at the value of cattle, to associate them
in worse than bestial habits, or let to them for hire at however
moderate a rent the certain occasions of suffering and
death.”</p>

<p>“Seeing the punctuality with which weekly visitation is
made for the collection of rents in these wretched dwellings
it would not be unreasonable to insist on some regulations
for the clean and wholesome condition of his premises,
water supply, and scavenging, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>Such a regulation would “render it indispensable to the
landlord of such holdings to promote cleanly and decent
habits among his tenants—even to obtain security for their
good behaviour.”</p>

<p>The picture thus presented of the sanitary condition of
the people residing in the “City” about the middle of the
last century is—it must be acknowledged—a terrible one;
but it rests upon unimpeachable testimony.</p>

<p>The very grave and serious conclusion, however, follows
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
from it—that if the evils were thus terrible in the “City,”
with a comparatively small population, only a little more
than a twentieth of that of the metropolis, and where there
was a local government with wide powers for dealing with
matters affecting the public health—how infinitely more
serious was the condition of things in the “greater London”
with its huge population, and where there was practically no
local government, and no punitive law for insanitary misdoings
and crimes.</p>

<p>In some degree, the evils the people suffered under were
of their own making, though many excuses can be urged in
extenuation. In some degree, too, the people were unquestionably
the victims of circumstances. But in the
main, they were the victims of other people’s iniquities.
It was those circumstances which the Government should
have altered, or, at any rate, have endeavoured to control or
modify—it was the unlimited power to do evil that the
Government should have checked and curbed; but “greater
London” was virtually left outside the pale of remedial
legislative treatment by Parliament.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h3><br />IV</h3>

<p>The great cholera epidemic of 1848–9 had deeply stirred
public feeling in London. It had destroyed 14,600 people
(and diarrhœa, its satellite, had destroyed many thousands
more), and it had been “accompanied by an amount of
sickness and physical misery beyond computation.” But
even all its horrors, and all the proofs it afforded of the
desperately insanitary condition of the masses in the
metropolis, were not sufficient to induce the Government
to depart from its policy of neglect, or to wring from
Parliament measures which would lay the basis for the
alleviation of the sufferings of the working population
of the metropolis, or which would remove even a small
part of the evils which fell so heavily upon those least able
to sustain them, and least able to remove them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The health of London was becoming worse every year.
The number of persons dying from preventable disease had
been steadily increasing.</p>

<p>One gleam of hope there was, however. An increasing
number of persons were becoming interested in the health
of the people, and were awakening to the gravity of the
subject, and to the public discredit and inhuman scandal
of the existing condition of things—an awakening of
interest which, in February, 1850, reached to the extent
of a public meeting.</p>

<p>The Bishop of London presided, and the meeting was
rendered the more remarkable by speeches from Lord
Ashley, then actively pressing sanitary and social questions
forward, and by Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>Lord Ashley <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“The condition of the metropolis, in a sanitary point
of view, was not only perilous to those who resided in it,
but it was an absolute disgrace to the century in which
they lived. It was a disgrace to their high-sounding professions
of civilisation and morality. They were surrounded
by every noxious influence—they were exposed to every
deadly pestilence…. The water they drank, the air they
breathed, the surface they walked on, and the ground
beneath the surface, all were tainted and rife with the
seeds of disease and death….</p>

<p>“Let them look at another abomination—the existence of
putrefying corpses in graveyards and in vaults amidst the
habitations of the living—an abomination discountenanced
by all the civilisation of modern days, as it was by that
of the ancient days—the practice of intramural interments.</p>

<p>“Could anything be worse than the graveyards of the
metropolis? Under a surface of ground not amounting
to 250 acres there had been interred within thirty years
in the metropolis far more than 1,500,000 human beings.
What must be the condition of the atmosphere affected
by the exhalations from that surface?…</p>

<p>“And what were the financial and social consequences
of allowing such a state of things to exist?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“At least one-third of the pauperism of the country arose
from the defective sanitary condition of large multitudes
of the people….”</p>

<p>Charles Dickens <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“The object of the resolution he was proposing was to
bring the Metropolis within the provisions of the Public
Health Act, most absurdly and monstrously excluded from
its operation…. Infancy was made stunted, ugly, and
full of pain; maturity made old; and old age imbecile.</p>

<p>“He knew of many places in London unsurpassed in the
accumulated horrors of their long neglect by the dirtiest
old spots in the dirtiest old towns under the worst old
governments in Europe.</p>

<p>“The principal objectors to the improvements proposed
were divided into two classes.</p>

<p>“The first consisted of the owners of small tenements,
men who pushed themselves to the front of Boards of
Guardians and parish Vestries, and were clamorous about
the rating of their property; the other class was composed
of gentlemen, more independent and less selfish, who had
a weak leaning towards self-government. The first class
generally proceeded upon the supposition that the compulsory
improvement of their property when exceedingly
defective would be very expensive….</p>

<p>“No one,” he went on to say, “who had any knowledge
of the poor could fail to be deeply affected by their patience
and their sympathy with one another—by the beautiful
alacrity with which they helped each other in toil, in the
day of suffering, in the hour of death.</p>

<p>“It hardly ever happened that any case of extreme protracted
destitution found its way into the public prints
without our reading at the same time of some ragged
Samaritan sharing his last loaf or spending his last penny
to relieve the poor miserable in the room upstairs or in the
cellar underground. It was to develop in the poor people
the virtue which nothing could eradicate, to raise them
in the social scale as they should be raised, to lift them
from a condition into which they did not allow their beast
to sink, … to cleanse the foul air for the passage of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Christianity and education throughout the land, that the
meeting was assembled. The object of their assembly was
simply to help to set that right which was wrong before
God and before man.”</p>

<p>The realisation of this object, noble as it was, was not
easily attainable.</p>

<p>The Vicar of St. Martin-in-the-Fields said that “the
difficulty of legislation in these matters was to hit the
medium between the rights of property and the rights
of humanity.” He might have added, with truth, that the
difficulty had so far been met by sacrificing the rights
of humanity to the rights of property.</p>

<p>Lord Ashley had pointed out that they “had to contend
with ignorance, indifference, selfishness, and interest;”
or as Lord Robert Grosvenor more vigorously expressed
it, in a phrase which should live in history as giving the
key to the mystery of the slow sanitary evolution of this
great city, they had to contend against “vested interests
in filth and dirt.”</p>

<p>One thing was already absolutely clear, that it was
hopeless to expect anything from the spontaneous action
of land-owners or house-owners.</p>

<p>“They knew it was quite impossible,” said the Bishop
of Chichester, “to bring the owners of even one small
court or alley, much less the owners or occupiers of any
large district, to concur in any measure for the general
good of their particular locality.”</p>

<p>The fact was that nothing but the imperative directions
of the law would secure the removal of evils or curtail the
practice of infamous abuses—and even when the law was
enacted for their remedy, nothing but its rigorous enforcement
with adequate penalties would make it effective.</p>

<p>As the result of the meeting, a deputation waited on
Lord John Russell, the then Prime Minister. His reply
was not encouraging.</p>

<p>“In this city,” he said, “there is very naturally and
properly great jealousy of any interference either with
local rights or individual will and freedom from control.”</p>

<p>That great jealousy proved to be so powerful that nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
was attempted by the Government except an abortive
effort to deal with the loathsome and insanitary evils of
intramural interments where vested interests were neither
powerful nor loud voiced.</p>

<p>The Act was so defective that it never came into operation,
and two more years elapsed before the Government
again essayed to deal with the subject. And in the
meanwhile that most horrible evil was permitted to work
its will upon the dwellers in the metropolis.</p>

<p>To the enthusiasm of an individual, and not of the
Government, was due the first effective attempt to grapple
with one of the widespread, deep-seated evils which were
working such havoc among the people. The most disastrous
and vicious forms of overcrowding were at the time
to be found in the so-called Common Lodging Houses—the
sink of insanitary abominations.</p>

<p>These were the temporary and casual abodes of the
dregs of London humanity—of the tramps, and the unfortunates,
and the mendicants and criminals, male and
female—when they could afford the penny or pence to
pay for their night’s lodging. In most cases these houses
were low brothels and hotbeds of crime and moral degeneracy,
their foul and filthy condition making them great
sources and propagators of contagious and loathsome
diseases.</p>

<p>In the “City” the authorities had power to regulate
and control them. Not so, however, in the metropolis.
There, no one had any authority in the matter, nor was
there any authority for any one to have.</p>

<p>Lord Ashley, truly discerning that the one and only
way of dealing with this evil was by regulation and constraint,
introduced a Bill<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and actually carried it through
Parliament, and two years later got another Act<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> embodying
amendments which made it more effective.</p>

<p>What the Common Lodging House owner or keeper—anxious
to secure the utmost profits from his property
and regardless of all consequences to others—would not
do, he was, by those Acts, made to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The houses which he devoted to this purpose, solely
for his own profit, were placed under the control and
inspection of the police, and had to be registered as
“Common Lodging Houses.” Overcrowding in them
was checked by restricting the number of inmates who
might be in each room; regulations (confirmed by a
Secretary of State) were made, and steadily enforced, for
the separation of the sexes; for the proper cleansing of
the houses; and for compelling the keeper to give
immediate notice of fever or any contagious or infectious
disease occurring therein. The accumulation of refuse
was to be prevented, and provision had to be made for
adequate sanitary accommodation, for better drainage,
and for sufficient water supply.</p>

<p>A very brief experience showed that great practical
benefits resulted from thus regulating these houses, and
the amount of sickness and mortality in them became
astonishingly small, considering the character of their
inmates and the localities where they were situated; and
inasmuch as the number of such houses was nearly 5,000,
and the population in them about 80,000, the benefit was
a really substantial one.</p>

<p>How obstinate and pertinacious was the opposition of
house-owners, or middlemen, to regulation and supervision
of any kind is illustrated by a case reported by the Assistant
Police Commissioner.<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The owner of certain premises in
St. Giles’ had been often applied to, without success, to
remedy some gross sanitary defects therein which had
resulted in the loss of life by fever. Brought to bay at last,
at the Police Court, and ordered to remedy the evil, he said
that he was willing to do all in his power to abate the
nuisance … but, “he thought he ought not to be dictated
to as to the way his property was to be managed.” His
words embodied the predominant spirit of the time. “There
are,” wrote the Assistant Police Commissioner in commenting
upon this case, “owners of property whom nothing
but the strong arm of the law can move.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Act did not go far enough. Single
rooms occupied by families did not come within its scope.
They constituted an enormous proportion of the habitations
of the people, and they were allowed to continue
the prolific cause of sanitary evils and of physical and moral
degradation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Limited in its scope though the Act was, it afforded
nevertheless one great object lesson—the lesson which since
that time has been consistently preached by all who had
actual experience as regarded the sanitary condition of the
people of London—the lesson that the worst of the sanitary
and social evils could only be effectually grappled with, on
the one side by the supervision and regulation and constant
inspection of the houses in which the poorer classes lived,
and upon the other side by insistent compulsion of house-owners
to maintain a certain standard of sanitation and
cleanliness in those houses.</p>

<p>That, however, was a course which Parliament for many
years did not think it desirable to adopt, and which, when
adopted in a tentative and half-hearted sort of way, suffered
the usual fate of sanitary legislation—that of being neglected,
opposed, evaded, or thwarted by land-owners, house-owners,
middlemen, and by hostile local authorities.</p>

<p>Lord Ashley also originated and succeeded in the same
Session in obtaining from Parliament another Act of
notable interest, namely, “The Labouring Classes Lodging
Houses Act,”<a id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> which aimed at increasing the quantity of
houses for working men by facilitating the establishment
of well-ordered houses for such persons.</p>

<p>It gave power to vestries to adopt the Act, and thereafter
to purchase or lease land, and to erect houses thereon
for the working classes, and to borrow money on the security
of the rates for this purpose.</p>

<p>In advocating his plan in the House of Commons he
enforced the importance of the reform. He <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“Until the domiciliary condition of the working classes
were Christianised (he could use no less forcible a term) all
hope of moral or social improvement was utterly vain.
Though not the sole, it was one of the prime sources of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>evils that beset their condition; it generated disease, ruined
whole families by the intemperance it promoted, cut off or
crippled thousands in the vigour of life, and filled the workhouses
with widows and orphans.”<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>He specially mentioned one of the objections urged to
this proposal for the construction of better houses—an
objection which since then has invariably found expression
when any amelioration of the housing of the working
classes has been proposed to be done by a public authority.</p>

<p>“It was said those matters ought to be left to private
speculation. He should much object to that. Private
speculation was very much confined to the construction of
the smallest houses, and of the lowest possible description,
because it was out of these the most inordinate profits could
be made. Private speculation was almost entirely in that
direction.”</p>

<p>He might have added that “private speculation” had
hitherto had a completely free field in the sphere of housing,
with all the evil results visible before them, and that it had
aggravated and intensified the evil instead of removing or
mitigating it.</p>

<p>The debate in Parliament was interesting, as it drew from
the Home Secretary an expression of the Government view
of the situation.</p>

<p>“After all,” said Sir G. Grey, “it was not to the Government,
it was rather to the efforts of individuals, and associations
of individuals, that they must look for real and
general improvement among the great body of the people.
All that the Government could do was to remove obstacles
in the way, and to present facilities by modifications of the
law more useful than direct legislation.”<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>An “association of individuals” had already been formed—“The
Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring
Classes”—and work of this class had to the extent of over
£20,000 been carried out by it. The new piles of buildings
erected were eagerly availed of by people of the working
classes, and in a sanitary point of view they at once demonstrated
their very satisfactory immunity from disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The Act, however, being a voluntary or adoptive Act, was
not likely to be adopted and put into force by those by
whom a certain amount of financial liability might be
incurred as the result. As a matter of fact it never was put
in force by any vestry, and it remained a dead letter.</p>

<p>It was memorable, however, as embodying for the first
time in legislation the idea that the housing of the people
was a public matter with which a public authority might
properly concern itself, even to the extent of competing
with private enterprise, and pledging the rates as security.</p>

<p>The supply of water to London, both as regarded quality
and quantity, had, since the epidemic of 1848–9, been engaging
the attention of Committees of Parliament, the
belief that the epidemic of cholera had been increased and
propagated by the filthy and impure water having given an
impetus to the demand for ameliorative measures. In 1852
an Act<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> was passed by which the companies taking their
water from the Thames were required to remove their
intakes to some place above Teddington Lock, where the
tide would not affect it, and the sewage of London would
not be intermixed with it. This was a considerable step in
the right direction, for though the river above Teddington
Lock received the sewage of many large towns and villages,
it was at least free from contamination by the sewage and
filth of the metropolis.</p>

<p>Other improvements were also enacted. Reservoirs
within a certain distance of St. Paul’s Cathedral were to
be covered in, and all water intended for domestic use was
to be filtered before being supplied to the consumer; and
provision was also made for a constant supply of water
by every company within five years after the passing of
the Act.</p>

<p>But the companies were given five years within which to
effect the removal of the intake from the foulest parts of
the river to above tidal reach—and thus for a wholly unnecessary
term the cause which had wrought such havoc
among the people was permitted to continue its disastrous
effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h3><br />V</h3>

<p>The epidemic of cholera in 1849 had failed to produce any
lasting effect upon the local authorities or the public opinion
of London, and the nemesis of renewed neglect and indifference
was once again to fall upon the metropolis.</p>

<p>Cholera had kept hovering about. In 1852 a number of
suspicious cases occurred in various districts. In 1853
suspicion passed into certainty, and the disease assumed
the form of an epidemic—as many as 102 deaths from
it occurring in the first week in November. Then it
died down.</p>

<p>In the following year it again appeared in more severe
epidemic form over the whole of the metropolis. On one
day—September 4th—there were 459 deaths from it. The
climax was reached in the second week in September
(almost the identical date on which the epidemic of 1849
occasioned the highest mortality) and there were 2,050
deaths from it.<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In that one month 6,160 persons died
from it, and from July 1st to December 16th, when it at
last disappeared, there was a total mortality from cholera
alone of 10,675 persons.</p>

<p>Every conclusion which had been arrived at as regards
the disease during the previous epidemics was confirmed by
this third great epidemic, and many previous theories passed
into the region of proved facts. Cholera was once more
proved to be a filth disease, and in the main confined to
filthy localities. The more defective and abominable the
methods of drainage, the larger the number of victims.
The filthier and more contaminated the water supplied for
drinking and household purposes, the more numerous the
cases, and the more virulent the disease. This was demonstrated
beyond further question.</p>

<p>The mortality on the south side of the Thames was above
threefold what it was on the north side; and both as regarded
water supply and drainage, South London was in a
worse sanitary state than North London. The water consumed
by the population there was generally worse than
that on the north. Lying lower, too, the drainage had less
chance of being conveyed away, and in the miles upon miles
of open sewer ditches it was left to rot and putrefy in close
propinquity to the houses and to poison the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>And the most remarkable proof was afforded by the
effects of the consumption of water taken from different
sources.</p>

<p>In 1849 both the Lambeth and the Southwark Water
Companies pumped the water they supplied to their
customers from the very foulest part of the Thames—near
Hungerford Bridge—with equally disastrous results. In the
course of the following years the Lambeth Company removed
its source of supply to a part of the river above Teddington
Lock—the Southwark Company, however, went on as
before. In the epidemic of 1854 the inhabitants of houses
supplied with the water by the latter company suffered eight
times as much as those supplied by the better water of the
Lambeth Company, whilst the number of persons who died
in the houses where the impure was drunk was three and a
half times greater than that in the houses where the purer
water was supplied.</p>

<p>Of all the conclusions arrived at by those who had been
engaged in combating the disease during this epidemic, the
most important was that where cholera had become
localised it was connected with obvious removable causes,
and was in fact a preventable disease.</p>

<p>Most unfortunately, and reprehensibly, many of those
who could have done most to prevent it failed signally to
take action.</p>

<p>Once more, and this time in an accentuated degree, the
widespread prevalence of the disease, and the frightful
mortality, were distinctly due to the inertia, laxity, or
deliberate neglect of those local authorities who by law
were charged with the duty of cleansing localities and
removing some of the causes of disease.</p>

<p>The General Board of Health, of which Sir Benjamin
Hall was President, did all that it could do. Medical
inspectors were appointed by it to visit all the parishes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
most severely affected; and the fullest and minutest
instructions were issued to the Boards of Guardians as to
the course they should pursue, and the action they
should take.</p>

<p>But several of the Boards of Guardians took no notice of
the instructions sent them; others sent unsatisfactory
replies. In not one of the parishes in which the epidemic
was most fatal was the preventive machinery, sanitary and
medical, organised in accordance with the instructions; and
although some parishes did more than others, yet, speaking
generally, the administration of the sanitary and medical
relief measures by the Boards of Guardians was inefficient
in character and extent, except in some of the larger and
more healthy parishes where they were least wanted.<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>At Rotherhithe, the Guardians declined to proceed with
the removal of nuisances as entailing a useless expense.
At Deptford, where cholera was at the worst, no Inspector
of Nuisances was appointed, even for the emergency. Nor
did Greenwich, where it was also bad, appoint one. In
Bethnal Green, where memories ought to have been bitter,
the authorities practically did nothing, although promising
almost everything.</p>

<p>In Lambeth, the parish was left without any adequate
protection against the epidemic; and it was only after
urgent remonstrances by the Medical Inspector, and after
his threatening to place himself in communication with the
coroner in any cases of death occurring in localities where
the proper cleansing measures had not been carried out,
that he succeeded in obtaining the adoption of measures
even to a limited extent.<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In Clerkenwell, the Guardians utterly disregarded the
recommendations of the Board of Health, and from the
first there was an openly expressed determination not in any
way to be interfered with by the Board.</p>

<p>And the disastrous state of affairs was, that the Nuisances,
&amp;c., Removal Acts gave the Board of Health no power to
enforce upon the Guardians the execution of the regulations
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole sanitary administration—so far as any existed
in London—was in a state of chaos, and the various local
authorities were able, with absolute impunity to themselves,
to ignore and even defy the General Board of Health. Of
these authorities, as has been already said, there was a
multiplicity, and it was no infrequent occurrence to find the
administrative authority of some of them in the hands of
parties directly interested in the continuance of the existing
state of matters, evil though those were. In fact, the
“vested interests in filth and dirt” were a power in local
administration in “greater London,” and the practical result
was that the great majority of the population of the metropolis
were left without any protection against the ravages of
epidemic or other preventable diseases.</p>

<p>The indifference of Parliament, moreover, had left London
without any effective or systematic sanitary supervision;
and in no part of it, except the “City,” was there any
officer conversant with the effect of local influences on the
health of the population, or who could advise as to the
sanitary measures which should be adopted.</p>

<p>The Board of Health having had it brought home to them
that, with their limited powers, they were unable to introduce
order into this chaos, or to enforce even the most
elementary precautions against the spread of the disease,
their President addressed a letter on the 29th of January,
1855, to Lord Palmerston, the then Home Secretary (and a
few weeks later the Prime Minister), in which he set forth
the exact state of affairs as ascertained by his own observation
and by the experience of some of the best and most
well-informed medical men in London.</p>

<p>In this letter he summarised the main causes of the
insanitary condition in which the people of London were
forced to live.</p>

<p>He <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The evidence on the localising conditions of cholera
given in the report of Dr. Sutherland points to the following
as among the more prominent of the removable causes
of zymotic disease.</p>

<p>“Open ditches as sewers. Want of sewers. Badly constructed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
sewers accumulating deposits and generating sewer
gases.</p>

<p>“The pollution of the atmosphere in streets and within
houses from untrapped drains, from sewer ventilating
openings in streets, and from cesspools, whereby the
air was contaminated and the sub-soil saturated with
filth.</p>

<p>“Want of house drainage.</p>

<p>“The absence of any organised daily system of cleansing,
and the consequent retention of house refuse in or near
dwellings.</p>

<p>“Bad water, badly distributed. Unwholesome trades.
Unwholesome vapours exhaled from the Thames. Cellar
habitations.</p>

<p>“Neighbourhoods, the houses of which are closely packed
together with narrow overcrowded streets, alleys and courts
so constructed as to prevent ventilation. Houses structurally
defective, filthy, unventilated, and overcrowded—absolutely
unfit for human habitation.”</p>

<p>And several others which need not be here enumerated.</p>

<p>“Lastly, and applying to all these—multiplicity of local
authorities, and the want of sufficient powers in such
authorities to deal with these evils.”</p>

<p>“Great as these evils are in London,” he wrote, “…
there is not one among them that cannot be remedied if
proper steps be taken.</p>

<p>“The first and most obvious necessity in the metropolis
is to sweep away the existing chaos of local jurisdiction.”</p>

<p>Included in that chaos were two Boards with great powers
of taxation over which the ratepayers had no control.<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>One of them consisted of the persons appointed under the
Metropolitan Building Act of 1844, who, at a cost of
£24,000 a year, entirely neglected their work. The other,
the Commissioners of Sewers, who had demonstrated their
utter incapacity, the cost of whose establishment was
“something extraordinary,” and who in the five years of
their existence had only attempted one great work—“the
Victoria Sewer”—which cost a large sum, and which not
many years after fell to ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The great epidemic of cholera, its attendant panic, its
gruesome accompaniments, its revelation of the actual
condition of the masses, and of the rottenness of the local
authorities, and the growing outcry against the iniquity of
such a state of things in a civilised and Christian country,
brought matters to a head.</p>

<p>The state of the Thames had also become a greater
danger than ever to the community, and a more unbearable
nuisance.</p>

<p>As described by <cite>The Lancet</cite> in July, <span class="no-break">1855:—</span></p>

<p>“The waters are swollen with the feculence of the
myriads of living beings that dwell upon the banks, and
with the waste of every manufacture that is too foul for
utilisation. Wheresoever we go, whatsoever we eat or
drink within the circle of London, we find tainted with the
Thames…. No one having eyes, nose, or taste, can look
upon the Thames and not be convinced that its waters are,
year by year, and day by day, getting fouler and more
pestilential…. The abominations, the corruptions we
pour into the Thames, are not, as some falsely say, carried
away into the sea. The sea rejects the loathsome tribute,
and heaves it back again with every flow. Here, in the
heart of the doomed city, it accumulates and destroys.”</p>

<p>And the Government, compelled at last by the force of
events to take some steps for the better sanitary government
of the metropolis, and for remedying some of the evils the
people suffered under, decided on taking action.</p>

<p>Acknowledging the necessity for giving local government
to “greater London”—the “City” of course already had its
own—it proposed the creation of a central authority which
should deal with certain matters affecting London as a
whole, and local authorities which should deal with local
affairs affecting their own localities.</p>

<p>And, in 1855, a group of measures giving effect to these
views, and containing also what amounted to a sanitary
code similar to that in the Public Health Act already for
years in force in England, was passed by Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Those most important measures marked the end of one
great period in the sanitary history of this great metropolis.</p>

<p>Of that period it is to be said that there is none in the
history of London in which less regard was shown for the
condition of the great mass of the inhabitants of the metropolis;
no period when the spirit of commercialism recked so
little of the physical condition and circumstances of those
upon whom, after all, it depended; no period when the
rights of property were so untrammelled by any consideration
for the welfare of human flesh and blood; no period
when private individuals not alone so strained, for their own
advantage or aggrandisement, the utmost rights the law
allowed them, but far exceeded those rights, and too often
successfully filched from the public that to which the law
gave them no right.</p>

<p>Never had there been a time in which the rights of
property had been more insisted upon and exercised. Never
a time in which land-owners, house-owners, and builders
did as freely as they liked with their own, regardless of the
injury or damage inflicted upon others; nor in which
manufacturers carried on, without interference, trades for
their own benefit, which were not merely offensive, but
actually death-dealing to their neighbours.</p>

<p>And throughout this period the people in their daily lives
and circumstances were absolutely unprotected by any
public authority, or by any local governing body. There
was no one to help them to contend against the extremest
exercise of real or even assumed rights.</p>

<p>In this period London, the metropolis, had grown up, and
had not merely been permitted by the Government and the
Legislature to grow up practically without government,
guidance, supervision, or restraint, but it had been absolutely
denied any system of local government, and so been denied
all provision for the sanitary needs of the community.</p>

<p>In 1835 a large and liberal measure of municipal self-government
was given to all the cities and towns and
municipalities large and small of England and Wales—many
of them not a tithe so populous as the great parishes
of London—and a governing body, elected by the ratepayers,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and with almost all the essential powers of local
government, was instituted in each. But the Municipal
Corporations Act expressly excluded the great towns which
surrounded the walls of the “City” and which constituted
the metropolis, and the law continued to recognise them
only as rural parishes.</p>

<p>Twelve years later, namely in 1847, the Towns Improvement
Act was passed, by which towns of much smaller
size were given facilities for obtaining considerable powers
of local government. By it general sanitary provisions
were framed, which, with the sanction of Parliament,
might be applied in any town for the management by the
local authorities of the supply of water, of drainage, of the
paving, cleansing, and lighting of the streets, and the
prevention of fires; and for the regulation of buildings,
of slaughter-houses, of public baths, and of the interment
of the dead.</p>

<p>But even this more limited but still liberal system of
local government was not extended to London, and once
more the metropolis was excluded.</p>

<p>The “City” did not wish to extend its own borders, and
the authorities of the “City” viewed with dislike the idea of
the creation at their very gates of local bodies which might
develop into formidable rivals.</p>

<p>And so “greater London” was left by successive governments
and by Parliament to scramble along as best she
could, and to suffer.</p>

<p>And just as there was no local government so were there
practically no laws safeguarding the sanitary condition
of the people except the temporary and imperfect ones
provided by the Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention
Acts of 1848, and such very limited protection as the
common law afforded.</p>

<p>The Public Health Act of 1848—a sanitary code in
itself—was an Act for England and Wales alone. The
benefits it conferred were refused to London; and, as a
consequence, the masses of her people were doomed to
continue in circumstances of the utmost misery; year by
year tens of thousands of her citizens were sent to an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
unnecessarily early death, and ten times their number were
made to undergo diseases which even then were recognised
as preventable.</p>

<p>And all the time that she was thus left without a local
government, without any permanent sanitary laws, other
forces were at work inflicting ever-widening evil, and
intensifying already existing evils.</p>

<p>The population had increased by leaps and bounds, and
the increasing trade of London had brought great numbers
of workmen to the metropolis. The necessity for offices
and warehouses had led to the substitution of such houses
for houses previously used as residences.</p>

<p>And so the growing population was forced to herd
ever closer together, houses were packed thicker and
thicker, and, in the central districts, every available spot
of ground was built upon. And the overcrowding of
human beings in those houses, and all the attendant
ills, increased countless-fold. And the result was unparalleled,
indescribable, unspeakable misery of the industrial
and working classes, and of the lower and poorer
orders.</p>

<p>Not merely years, but generations of neglect and indifference
on the part of the governing classes had multiplied
and intensified in London every evil to which the poorer
classes of a nation are liable.</p>

<p>For long the great process of social and economic change
at work in “greater London,” and all that it entailed, was
let go its own way—a way which, in default of the regulation
and the alleviation a government should have given
it, was beset with creakings and groanings like those of
some badly constructed piece of machinery; only instead
of machinery, inanimate and insensitive, they were the
groanings, the agonies, of suffering thousands and tens
of thousands of sick and perishing people, sinking annually
into the abyss.</p>

<p>All through the earlier half of the nineteenth century, in
fact, London, the great metropolis, was left to evolve itself
so far as regarded the public health and sanitary condition
of the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The tremendous import of such deliberate inaction by
Parliament, and by successive Governments, is even now
only partly comprehended. But the nemesis has been
truly a terrible one. The injury wrought was in many
ways irreparable, and we are still reaping the crop of evil
sown by such seed—are still far from the end of the
appalling consequences such a disastrous policy has entailed.</p>

<h2 class="chaptHead"><a id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">1855–1860</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Act “for the better Local Management of the
Metropolis”<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> which was passed by Parliament in 1855 was
the turning point in the sanitary history and evolution of
London.</p>

<p>It put a term to the chaos of local government in “greater
London” and swept away the three hundred trumpery and
petty existing local governing bodies. It created a legally
recognisable metropolis by defining its component parts and
boundaries. It established a definite system of local
representative government in that metropolis for the
administration of its local affairs. It conferred upon the
new authorities not only the powers vaguely possessed and
imperfectly, if at all, acted on by their predecessors, but
a considerable number of new ones. It laid the basis of an
organisation for the sanitary supervision of the inhabitants
of each parish of greater London.</p>

<p>And with the object of making provision for the effective
treatment of some of the numerous matters affecting
London as a whole—matters of a general and not of a local
character—with which smaller local authorities could not
possibly deal, and with the further object of securing a
certain uniformity of administration by the new local
authorities, it founded a central governing body for the
metropolis.</p>

<p>Simultaneously Parliament passed a new “Nuisances
Removal Act for England”<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> which was made applicable to
London, and which, coupled with the health provisions in
the Metropolis Local Management Act, bestowed upon the
metropolis a sort of code of sanitary laws in some degree
similar to those enjoyed by other parts of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>And also an Act<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> making stricter provisions as to the
construction of buildings in the metropolis.</p>

<p>Though three Acts were thus passed, they formed but
separate parts of one general plan of reform.</p>

<p>Some little detail must be gone into as regards the system
of local government thus initiated.</p>

<p>For government in purely local matters—in each of the
twenty-three largest parishes, definite Vestries, as distinguished
from parishioners meeting in open Vestry, were
constituted, the members thereof being elected by the
householders of the respective parishes rated to the relief
of the poor. The total number of members on any Vestry
was not to exceed one hundred and twenty, and each year
one-third of them were to retire, and an election to be held
to fill their places.</p>

<p>And as there were many parishes so small that to have
constituted them separate local governing authorities would
have perpetuated all the evils of small areas of local
government, these small parishes were grouped together
into “districts” of a fairly large size, for each of which—some
fourteen in number—there was to be a governing body
entitled “The Board of Works for the —— District,” the
members thereof being elected, not directly by the electors,
but by the smaller Vestries constituting the District.</p>

<p>These new local governing bodies were thus representative
bodies, the Vestries elected directly by the ratepayers, the
District Boards indirectly elected; but both were constituted
“the sanitary authority” for their respective areas, both
were charged with the administration of local affairs, and so
the term “Vestry” and the “District Board” may be taken
as synonymous.</p>

<p>The central body which was constituted for dealing with
matters affecting London as a whole was named “The
Metropolitan Board of Works.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>It was not directly elected by the ratepayers of London,
but was elected by the aforesaid local authorities and by
the “City.”</p>

<p>It consisted of forty-five members. Three were elected by
“the Mayor, aldermen, and commons of the City of London
in common council assembled.”</p>

<p>Each of the six largest Vestries elected two of their
members to it; the other Vestries one each, and the District
Boards of Works elected the remainder.</p>

<p>It was thus representative of the whole of London—City
and Metropolis included. Each year one-third of the
members were to retire, and one-third to be elected in
their place.</p>

<p>This central Board was charged with many important
duties affecting London as a whole. Foremost amongst
them was the first essential of any sanitary well-being—the
improvement of the sewerage and drainage of London.</p>

<p>This new body superseded the Commissioners of Sewers,
and was specially charged with the task of designing and
carrying out “a system of sewerage which should prevent
all or any part of the sewage within the metropolis from
passing into the river Thames in or near the metropolis:
and also make all such other sewers and works as they may
from time to time think necessary for the effectual sewerage
and drainage of the metropolis.”</p>

<p>It was also given general control over the sewage works,
and power to make orders for controlling Vestries and
District Boards in the construction of sewers in their
respective parishes.</p>

<p>Furthermore it was given power to make, widen, or
improve, any streets or roads in the metropolis for
facilitating the traffic, and certain powers of prohibiting the
erection of buildings beyond the regular line of buildings.
It was given power, too, to make bye-laws—for regulating
the plans, level, and width, &amp;c., of new streets and roads;
for the plans and level of sites for building; for the cleansing
of drains, and their communication with sewers; for the
emptying, closing, and filling up of cesspools; for the removal
of refuse, and generally, for carrying into effect the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
purposes of the Act—all which bye-laws were to be enforced
by the Vestries and District Boards.</p>

<p>Thus it was given large powers to deal with many of the
matters which most affected the public health. But in some
other such matters—essential for the effectiveness of the
whole scheme—it was left strangely helpless. It was given
no power to appoint a Medical Officer of Health for the
metropolis to advise it as to matters affecting the health of
London as a whole; or to appoint Inspectors of Nuisances
to ascertain information upon sanitary matters and to carry
out various sanitary duties.</p>

<p>But, gravest and most deleterious defect of all, no
authority was conferred upon the Board to compel any
negligent or recalcitrant local authorities to carry out the
duties imposed upon them by Parliament or by bye-laws
of the Board. Those authorities might with absolute
impunity neglect to carry out even the imperative directions
of Parliament as embodied in the Act, and thus what
Parliament emphatically enacted “shall” be done might
be left undone, with the most disastrous consequences to
the public health, not merely of the particular parish, but
to the great community of London.</p>

<p>The omission of some such provision made the Vestries
practically independent bodies, and arbiters as to the
administration or non-administration of various important
provisions of existing or future Acts of Parliament, and
afforded them the opportunity, so freely and widely availed
of, of not performing duties against their own opinions or
interests.</p>

<p>As regarded these newly created local authorities—the
“Vestries” and the “District Boards of Works”—the
powers and duties conferred upon them were extensive.</p>

<p>All the powers and duties of the previous local authorities
as regarded paving, lighting, watering, and cleansing,
or improving any parish, were transferred to them.</p>

<p>The sewers, other than the main sewers, were vested in
them, with the contingent duty of maintaining, repairing,
and cleansing them, and they were given power to put
sewers in every street. Also, they were given power,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
under certain circumstances, to compel owners of houses,
“whether built before or after the commencement of this
Act,” to construct drains into the common sewer.</p>

<p>Furthermore, no house was to be built without drains
constructed to the satisfaction of the Vestry, or without
sufficient sanitary conveniences, and they were directed to
cause open ditches, sewers, and drains of an offensive
nature, or likely to be prejudicial to health, to be cleansed,
filled up, and covered. And they were required to appoint
scavengers to collect the dirt and rubbish, or to contract for
its removal.</p>

<p>And each of the authorities was to appoint one or more
Medical Officers of Health, whose duty it should be to
inspect and report periodically upon the sanitary condition
of the parish or district, and who would act as medical
adviser to the Vestry in all matters relating to the public
health, and was also to appoint one or more Inspectors of
Nuisances to report as to the existence of nuisances or
disease, and perform various other duties in connection with
the sanitary condition of the parish.</p>

<p>Provision was also made for the prevention of the sale of
food unfit for human consumption.</p>

<p>The Sanitary Inspector “might at all reasonable times
inspect and examine any carcase, meat, poultry, game,
flesh, fish, fruit, vegetables, corn, bread, or flour exposed
for sale,” and in case the same appeared to him to be
unfit for such food it might be seized, and the magistrate
might order it to be destroyed, and the person to whom it
belonged, or in whose custody it was found, should on
conviction be liable to a penalty of £10.</p>

<p>By “The Nuisances Removal Act for England” the word
“nuisances” was so defined as to include any accumulation
or deposit which was injurious to health, “any premises in
such a state as to be injurious to health, any pool, ditch,
water-course, cesspool, drain, or ashpit, &amp;c., so foul as to be
a nuisance or injurious to health.”</p>

<p>The right to give notice to the sanitary authority of the
existence of a nuisance was extended, and the process was
facilitated. Notice might be given to the sanitary authorities
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
by the person aggrieved, by the sanitary inspector, or
by a constable, or by two inhabitant householders of the
parish; and certain powers of entry were given to the local
authority or their officer. The justices who heard the case
might require the person offending to provide sufficient
sanitary accommodation, means of drainage, or ventilation,
to abate the nuisance, or to whitewash, disinfect, or purify
the premises which were a nuisance, and could inflict a
fine for contravention of the order of abatement; and, if
the nuisance proved to exist were such as, in their judgment,
to render a house unfit for human habitation, they were
given authority even to prohibit the using thereof until it
was rendered fit.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as regarded certain noxious trades, including
slaughter-houses and manufactories causing effluvia,
which were certified by the Medical Officer of Health to
be a nuisance, or injurious to the health of the inhabitants
of the neighbourhood, the owner or occupier of the
premises might be proceeded against, and, on conviction,
fined.</p>

<p>Against the monster evil of “overcrowding” Parliament
made an attempt to legislate specifically, thus formally
recognising the necessity for dealing with it.</p>

<p>“Whenever the Medical Officer of Health shall certify to
the local authority that any house is so overcrowded as to
be dangerous or prejudicial to the inhabitants, and the
inhabitants shall consist of more than one family, the local
authority shall cause proceedings to be taken before the
justices to abate such overcrowding, and the justices shall
thereupon make such order as they may think fit, and the
person permitting such overcrowding shall forfeit a sum not
exceeding forty shillings.”</p>

<p>And an effort was also made to curtail the practice of
living in underground rooms and cellars by defining what
such a room or cellar was, and making liable to a penalty
“whoever let, occupied, or knowingly suffered to be occupied,
any room or cellar contrary to the Act.”<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>As money was essential for the working of the Acts, over
and above that for which rates could be levied, power
was given both to the Metropolitan Board of Works and
to the Vestries and District Boards of Works to borrow
money on the security of the rates, and repayable by
instalments, “provided always that no money should
be so borrowed by Vestries or District Boards without
the previous sanction in writing of the said Metropolitan
Board.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>There were to be auditors of the accounts of the
local authorities, who were to be annually elected at the
same time and in the same manner as members of
the Vestry.</p>

<p>Finally, each Vestry and District Board of Works was
to make to the Metropolitan Board of Works an annual
report of its proceedings, including a report from the
Medical Officer of Health; and the Metropolitan Board
was to make an annual report of its proceedings, and
present a copy to one of Her Majesty’s Secretaries of
State.</p>

<p>The third of these Acts, “The Metropolitan Building
Act, 1855,” amended the existing laws relating to buildings
in the metropolis, and laid down an elaborate code for
the regulation and supervision of all new buildings. Most
of this code related to the structure—the thickness of
walls, &amp;c., &amp;c.—and had primarily in view the security of
the house from destruction by fire. Only a few sections
in the Act related to the infinitely more important
matter of adequate provision for the health of the
inhabitants, and those dealt with it in the most niggardly
way.</p>

<p>A minimum of one hundred square feet was laid down
as satisfying the requirements of open space for air and
ventilation around a dwelling; a minimum of seven feet
in height was held to satisfy the requirements of any room
in a house.</p>

<p>And the supervision of every building, and every work
done in or upon any building, was entrusted to the
“District Surveyors”—officials taken over by the Metropolitan
Board from the previous body, appointed under the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Building Act of 1844, which had distinguished itself by its
incapacity.</p>

<p>These Acts practically laid down the framework of the
machinery of the sanitary government of London, and
struck the first real blow at the roots of the insanitary
condition of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The callous indifference and inaction of generations had
left not a mere Augean stable to be cleansed, but a great
city over 100 square miles in extent and containing two and
a half millions of people, and the new authorities, when they
came into existence, had not only to meet the daily needs of
a vast existing population, but to make good the neglect of
centuries, and to build up a sound and effective working
system of sanitary administration.</p>

<p>The task lying before them was one of enormous
proportions, for on them rested the responsibility of
effecting the sanitary redemption of the millions of the
metropolis—as well as the infinitely greater duty of safeguarding
future generations from similar sufferings and
wrongs.</p>

<p>It was, moreover, a task of almost superhuman difficulty,
for arrayed against reform and amelioration were the
powerful forces of “vested rights in filth and dirt.”
And adding to the difficulty was the huge inert mass of
ignorance, and poverty, and helplessness of masses of the
people.</p>

<p>One principle contained in these Acts was of pre-eminent
consequence—namely, the responsibility of “ownership.”
Hitherto owners had effectually escaped all responsibility
as regarded the sanitary state of their property, and had
dealt with their property exactly as they pleased, and
regardless of the consequences to any one but themselves.</p>

<p>Parliament now formally recognised and definitely laid
down the principle that the “owner” was the person
responsible for the insanitary condition of his property;
and in addition declared that individuals would not in future
be allowed to deal with their property in such a manner
as to cause injury to the public health.</p>

<p>But declaration of principles was one thing—their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
enforcement was another. Unfortunately, those who were
charged with their enforcement were too often the persons
directly interested in resisting reform, and in very
many instances, where even a partial enforcement of
these principles was attempted, the action was resented
and vigorously resisted.</p>

<p>The Metropolis Local Management Act came into force
on January 1, 1856, and the Central Authority—the
Metropolitan Board of Works—and the local authorities—Vestries
and District Boards—having been duly elected,
entered upon their duties.</p>

<p>The first and most urgent work which the Metropolitan
Board was charged to carry out was the main drainage
of the metropolis, and at the outset, the new Board directed
its efforts almost exclusively to the highly technical task
of devising and considering and adopting plans for the
construction of a great system of sewerage which should
intercept the flow of sewage into the Thames, and should
convey it by other means to a safe distance below London,
whence it might flow into the sea.</p>

<p>Any plan had, however, to be approved by the Chief
Commissioner of Works. To him the Board submitted
three plans, but none of them received such approval, and
the matter was at a deadlock until 1858, when an Act was
passed removing the veto of the Chief Commissioner of
Works, and at the same time giving the Metropolitan Board
power to raise a loan of £3,000,000, which up to that time
it had no power to do.</p>

<p>Within a week from the passing of that Act, the Board
determined on a plan, and began arrangements for carrying
it out.</p>

<p>The plan adopted was to intercept all the sewage flowing
into the Thames within the area of the metropolis, and to
convey it by sewers to a distance, and to discharge it into
the river at such a condition of tide as should take it still
further out, so as not to return and become a nuisance to
the metropolis. The proposed interception on the north
side was by three main sewers, discharging at Barking—the
upper, the middle, and the lower, with branches; on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the south side, by two main sewers, discharging at
Crossness.</p>

<p>As the result of the Act there had been transferred to the
Board 106 miles of main sewers on the north side of the
Thames with 33 outlets into the river, and 60 miles on
the south side with 31 outlets. A considerable number
of these were offensive open sewers, others were defective
in design and construction, whilst all required reconstruction
to make them effective, and to fit them for connection with
the new system.</p>

<p>The Central Authority had thus a heavy task before it,
and one which it would take years to perform.</p>

<p>The local authorities, with simpler duties to perform,
were able to get quicker to work.</p>

<p>They appointed “Surveyors” in each parish to look after
the multifarious duties in connection with the paving,
lighting, and cleansing of the streets, with scavenging, and
the removal of house and trade refuse, and with the construction
and maintenance of local sewers and drains.
In a sort of way some of this work had been done by the
previous petty authorities; parts of it, therefore, were more
or less familiar, and so not wholly new.</p>

<p>But wholly new, and of very great importance, were the
appointments which the new local authorities had to make
for their districts of a Medical Officer of Health, and of one
or more Inspectors of Nuisances to help him.</p>

<p>The duties of the Medical Officer of Health were carefully
prescribed by the Act. He was to inspect and report
periodically upon the sanitary condition of the parish;
to ascertain the existence of diseases increasing the rate
of mortality; to point out the existence of any causes likely
to originate or maintain such diseases, as well as to suggest
the most efficacious mode of checking and preventing their
spread, and various other important sanitary duties.</p>

<p>These appointments were duly made, and some appointments
also of Inspectors of Nuisances.</p>

<p>Herein was involved the clear recognition of another
principle of the utmost consequence—that of inspection—a
principle very naturally held in abhorrence by all sanitary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
misdoers. It had previously been put spasmodically into
operation, and with the best effects, on the occasions when
Asiatic cholera was approaching or raging in the country,
but when the panic had subsided it was promptly dropped,
and every one was practically left free to commit any
sanitary enormity with impunity. Henceforth, however,
there would be the contingency of being found out for
breaches of sanitary laws, and the eye of the law would,
at least theoretically, be upon sanitary law breakers.</p>

<p>The majority of the Medical Officers of Health entered
energetically on their work, and thenceforward a constant
light was thrown upon the sanitary condition of various
parts of the metropolis by men who lived in the closest and
most unceasing contact with the devastating evils afflicting
the masses of the people. All were not equally efficient or
energetic—all were not equally communicative—but the
reports of many of them are full of interesting facts, of
acute and instructive comment, and of wise counsel; and
though holding office at the pleasure of their employers,
many of these officers were courageously independent and
outspoken in their criticism and advice.<a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the reports had practically no circulation
beyond the members of the bodies to whom they were
made, if even they were read by them, and the recommendations
made therein were too often absolutely ignored
by those bodies, or, for reasons of self-interest, opposed.</p>

<p>To us now, however, these reports are of the greatest
value, being in many respects the most valuable official
records existing on the subject. We learn from them,
better than we do from any other source, as regards the
various parishes of London, the nature, and in some
measure the extent of the evils which existed, and the causes
of those evils; we find in them opinions expressed and
reiterated as to the best way of remedying those evils, and
accounts of the results of the efforts made to remove or cure
those evils.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<p>The reports set forth facts demonstrating the appalling
misery which the great masses of the people of the metropolis
endured; the loathsome foulness in which vast
numbers of them habitually lived, and were allowed to live;
the dreadful hardships they had to suffer; the fearful moral
and physical contamination they underwent; the terrible
death-roll—in great part preventable—and the ten or
twenty-fold larger roll of victims of preventable illnesses
and epidemics, with the consequent poverty which sickness
entailed.</p>

<p>We can bit by bit piece together from these reports
a realistic picture of the sanitary condition of London as
a whole during the successive periods of the latter half
of the nineteenth century, and we can discern the action
of the silent, steady, and irresistible economic forces which
unintermittently dominated that condition. North and
south in the metropolis, east and west, it was all the
same, varying only in intensity, in extent, and, in some
degree, in form; a harrowing and almost incredible story.
And the remarkable concurrence of testimony from men
acting independently of each other, and resident in wholly
different parts of London, justifies the fullest confidence in
statements uniformly harmonious.</p>

<p>The metropolis is so large a place, with such marked
differences between its component parts, differences in
situation, and physical characteristics, and degree of
development—differences in wealth and poverty, and in the
occupations of their inhabitants—that the attempt to trace
any special branch of its history is beset with the greatest
difficulties.</p>

<p>Especially is this the case when the subject treated of is
so complex and comprehensive as that of the public health.</p>

<p>It is manifest that all parts of the metropolis cannot
be described simultaneously—whilst to go “seriatim” into
the history of the public health in each separate locality
would, by the very weight of detail, fail to convey an impression
of the subject as a whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The same objections apply to a “seriatim” historic
treatment of the different branches of the public health.</p>

<p>Moreover, the action of the central authority has also to
be described in its proper place.</p>

<p>And, still more important, the action of Parliament,
and the principal Acts of Parliament relating to matters
affecting the public health, either directly or administratively.</p>

<p>How then can the subject be best treated with the object
of presenting the main facts of the sanitary evolution of
London, and deducing from them the lessons of experience
and guidance for the future?</p>

<p>Probably by a sort of compromise between these two
methods—taking groups of districts instead of separate
districts—and groups of matters pertaining to the public
health, instead of separate subjects—and, furthermore,
dealing with the whole subject in certain definite periods.
Groups of parishes have already, for certain health purposes,
been classified into central, eastern, northern, western, and
southern. That classification can be adhered to here.</p>

<p>And inasmuch as almost the only reliable statistics as
to many matters relating to the public health are those
afforded every decade by the census, the narrative can best
be treated by taking decennial periods, and utilising the
reliable information of the census for the deduction of
conclusions which on any other basis might be unsound.
This method, then, though in many respects imperfect, is
adopted as probably the best for tracing the sanitary
evolution of the great metropolis.</p>

<p>Foremost among the central group, but standing by itself,
and in the main outside the scope of the legislation, was the
“City.” To the description of its condition already given
nothing need be added beyond the statement of the fact
that the great economic forces at work therein were displaying
their results in the “City” itself in very striking
manner.</p>

<p>Under their potent influence the population there had
begun to rapidly decline. In 1851 it had been 127,533.
In 1861 it had come down to 111,784. The number of
inhabited houses was likewise rapidly declining. In 1851
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
there had been 14,483; in 1861 there were 13,218. Under
the irresistible demands for greater business and trading
accommodation, the inhabited houses there were being
rapidly converted to the more profitable purpose of business
offices, or warehouses.</p>

<p>As the number of business premises and shops increased
in a locality, so did the better-to-do residents leave it,
and migrate to pleasanter or more healthy localities. Some
of the houses thus vacated became promptly tenanted by
numerous families of a lower, or even the lowest classes;
until they too were converted to business purposes,
and their inhabitants once more turned adrift to seek
other habitation. Some of these people secured in the
neighbouring parishes residence in one or part of one of
those jerry-built and insanitary constructions which land-owners
and builders were erecting as rapidly as possible
upon any unbuilt ground which they owned, or which they
could lay hands upon—the majority contented themselves
with squeezing somehow into tenement houses already
overcrowded.</p>

<p>It cannot be too constantly borne in mind that this was
one of the great forces in unceasing action in the metropolis,
extending its sphere of action step by step, and stage by
stage, and that as years went on, the various districts of the
metropolis were, one and all, in varying degree, subject to
the accompaniments and consequences of its different stages
of growth. And the transition was further aggravated by
the natural increase of population, and by another great
force—the unceasing flow of immigrants into the metropolis,
the majority in search of work, others of food given
by charitable people, or of any other chance good thing or
adventure that might turn up.</p>

<p>And so, on January 1, 1856, the new local authorities
of the metropolis began their great task. And about forty
Medical Officers of Health began to examine into and
inspect their respective districts, and to inform or advise
their respective authorities.</p>

<p>What did these men find when they got well into their
work? What opinions did they form as to the fearful facts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
with which they were promptly brought face to face, and
the great social problems with which they were confronted?
And what did they and their employers, the Vestries and
District Boards, do to carry out the legislation which
Parliament had at last enacted?</p>

<p>The first impression of one of them was that the possessor
of the office of Medical Officer of Health<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> could never
become popular, “his functions bringing him into constant
collision with the apparent interests of many influential
persons;”—in other words, with vested interests.</p>

<p>Others took a less personal and wider view of their duties.
Thus one of them<a id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“We have to remodel an old system—a system on which
has been for centuries engrafted by slow degrees all the
undesirable elements we now wish to eradicate.”</p>

<p>Another<a id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> was impressed by the vast amount to be done
even in his own <span class="no-break">parish:—</span></p>

<p>“From what I daily witness, I make bold to state that
this Vestry has a Herculean task to perform to abate all the
nuisances of Rotherhithe; nuisances which have grown
uninterrupted for ages, and have become inveterate customs
with many.”</p>

<p>If it was a Herculean task in one parish, and that a small
one, what was the task for the whole of the metropolis?</p>

<p>Another,<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> after a few years’ experience of the working of
the Act, summed up the actual position—the very kernel
of the case—when he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The working of the Metropolis Management Act might
often be characterised as a war of the community against
individuals for the public good.”</p>

<p>And that is what, undoubtedly, it amounted to. Hitherto
the “individuals” had had their own way unchallenged and
unchecked, and countless thousands of the community had
been sent to their doom. Now, in a sort of way, it was to
be a war—a very just and necessary, and on the part of the
community a bloodless war—to enforce upon land-owners,
and house-owners and house-middlemen, obedience to the
principle that “property has its duties as well as its rights,”
and that those individual rights should not be exercised—as
they had hitherto so cruelly been—to the mortal injury of
vast numbers of the community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>And there was yet another aspect of their work being a
war. It was war against disease and filth, and all the causes
of insanitation, and against the consequent human suffering
and misery, and degradation, in some of the very worst
forms.</p>

<p>That, unfortunately, was a never-endable war. Great
successes might be won—complete and final victory never.</p>

<p>The central group of parishes and districts outside the
“City”—and lying to the north and west of the “City,”
consisted of St. Luke, Clerkenwell, Holborn, St. Giles’, the
Strand, and St. Martin-in-the-Fields, with a population of
close upon 288,000—about one-ninth of that of the metropolis.
Already in four of these, under the influence of the economic
forces already described, the population was decreasing.
Every portion of this central group was densely populated,
and it contained two of the most crowded of all the areas
of the metropolis—the Strand, which stood highest, and St.
Luke’s, which had “the questionable distinction” of being
the second most densely populated parish. In St. Giles’,
which was “amongst the oldest, most densely peopled, and
most deteriorated portions of London,” the population in
1851 “did not appear capable of further increase, the district
being incapable of expansion either by packing closer or by
the addition of new houses.”</p>

<p>The eastern group consisted of the parishes or districts
of Shoreditch, Whitechapel, Bethnal Green, Mile-End-Old-Town,
St. George-in-the-East, Limehouse, and Poplar.</p>

<p>In Whitechapel the population was stationary; in all the
others increasing.</p>

<p>The northern group of parishes and districts consisted of
Hackney, Islington, St. Pancras, St. Marylebone, and
Hampstead.</p>

<p>In every one of these the population was on the increase,
slightly in St. Marylebone, very rapidly in most of them,
notably so in St. Pancras and Islington.</p>

<p>The western group consisted of Westminster, St. James’,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
St. George (Hanover Square), Paddington, Kensington,
Fulham, and Chelsea.</p>

<p>In St. James’ the population was decreasing (having
reached its apogee in 1841); in Westminster it was slightly
increasing; in all the others rapidly increasing.</p>

<p>The southern group, with a population roughly of about
700,000, consisted of the whole of that portion of the
metropolis which was situate on the south side of the
river. Beginning on the west, there was Wandsworth
(which included Battersea), then Lambeth, Camberwell,
Lewisham, with Woolwich and Plumstead on the extreme
east, then Greenwich, Rotherhithe, Bermondsey, St. Mary,
Newington, St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark, St. Saviour,
Southwark, and St. Olave, in Southwark.</p>

<p>Many of these were still mostly country.</p>

<p>The various parishes and districts of the metropolis
differed remarkably in their rate of increase of population.
In all, the number of births was in excess of the number
of deaths, but as this excess in no way accounted for the
increase in many of them, the rest of the increase could
only be accounted for by immigration—immigration either
from other parishes or from outside London.</p>

<p>And as it was with population so it was with the houses
in which the people dwelt.</p>

<p>In most of the central parts of London, houses crowded
every available scrap of land, squares and open spaces being
few and far between. Where there should have been streets of
good width, there were narrow lanes of houses; where there
should have been thoroughfares, there were cul-de-sacs;
where there should have been space for through currents
of air and for light, there were brick walls stopping both
light and air.</p>

<p>Figures giving so many houses to the acre convey little
actual idea of the density of houses. Far more suggestive
is such a statement as that made by the Medical Officer of
Health in Limehouse (1861) that: “There would be no
difficulty in marking out courts and alleys where the
problem would seem to have been with the originators,
how to enable the greatest number of people to live in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
smallest amount of space.” Or the description of St. Giles’,<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
where, “exclusive of mews, there may be counted on the
map upwards of seventy streets, courts, and alleys, in which
there is no thoroughfare, or which are approached by
passages under houses.” Nor is it a matter of surprise
that this state of things should have come about, when
hitherto there had been practically no check whatever upon
building.</p>

<p>“It is to be regretted,” wrote the Medical Officer of
Health for Mile-End-Old-Town about his own district
(1856), “that the great increase in the number of habitations
should have been allowed to take place without some
municipal direction, or some supervision competent to
supply its place; the general salubrity of the district would
certainly have been better secured…. But every owner
of a piece of ground has had the opportunity of making the
most of it for his own advantage and in real opposition to
the public good.”</p>

<p>In nearly all the non-central parts of London houses were
increasing rapidly.</p>

<p>“Bricklayers are spreading the webs and meshes of houses
with such fearful rapidity in every direction that people are
being gradually confined within narrow prisons only open at
the top for the admission of what would be air if it were
not smoke.</p>

<p>“Suburban open spaces are being entombed in brick and
mortar mausoleums for the suffocation as well as for the
accommodation of an increasing populace.”<a id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Thus in Islington there were 13,500 houses in 1851, and
20,700 in 1861; in Kensington 6,100 in 1851, and 9,400
in 1861.</p>

<p>But what evoked comment was, that the evils of one sort
or another connected with the crowding of houses together
were being perpetuated.</p>

<p>“Not only is it to be deplored,” wrote the Medical Officer
of Health for Whitechapel, “that the houses in most of the
poor neighbourhoods are already too closely packed together,
but the evil is increasing: for wherever there is a vacant
spot of ground, more houses are built, thereby still further
diminishing the healthiness of those already existing”
(1860–1).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>From Hampstead—still but little built on—came a complaint
of “the tendency among builders to cover the new
ground as thickly and at as little cost as practicable.”</p>

<p>In Wandsworth “houses were erected and new streets
formed without due regard to sanitary requirements, and in
situations where good drainage seems impossible.”</p>

<p>In Fulham, “cottages out of number were constructed in
the excavations of old brick fields with the soft refuse of
bricks, habitations run in swamps and quagmires, and their
foundations three parts of the year sopped with surface
water.”</p>

<p>Efficient sewerage was so manifestly the basis of all wise
sanitation that the want of sewers, and the abominable
condition of those which existed, were general subjects of
complaint.</p>

<p>The Strand boasted of being “one of the best sewered
districts in the metropolis,” which, however, was not saying
much for it. And in St. Giles’ the sewerage was stated to
be good, and “much above the average of the town.”</p>

<p>But such reports were quite exceptional. In Hackney,
the principal sewer was the former Hackney Brook, which,
from the increase of the population, and the drainage from
other sewers, houses, cemeteries, and cattle-market, had
become a foul open ditch—with very trifling exception
wholly uncovered—and “emitting pestiferous noxious
effluvia.”</p>

<p>In St. Marylebone, the sewers, themselves insufficient for
the requirements of a growing population (1858), were, in
many cases, so shallow as to cause rather than remove evil,
for in certain places they flooded the basements, and in
more than one house was witnessed the curious spectacle
of the daily use of pumps to remove the foul liquids, as in
leaking ships.</p>

<p>In Paddington (1857–8), “the principles of good town
drainage were completely ignored. The sewers were those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
which had been constructed at intervals, previous to 1846,
in a piecemeal and unsatisfactory manner, as the thoroughfares
were formed, without any regard to the requirements
of the adjoining streets.” The general direction of these
sewers was “extremely defective. Numbers of them have
a fall towards the summit or highest level of the street
through which they pass; the bottoms are very irregular,
running up and down and forming successions of hills and
hollows.”</p>

<p>In Fulham, there existed scarcely the trace of a main
sewer, open sewers and filthy ditches, conveying some part
of the sewage to the river, the rest remaining in the
cesspools.</p>

<p>In Hammersmith, not only were sewers and ditches in a
most fearful state of nuisance, but there was also “a morass
of several acres in extent, having no outlet, which received
the sewage from a large area, the noxious emanations
from which must be regarded as highly detrimental to
health.”</p>

<p>On the south side of the river matters were still worse.
The greater number of the southern districts were situate
nearly on the same level as high-water mark, if not indeed
below it, and they differed from the other districts of
London in their marshy character, their low level, and
in the want of proper drainage dependent on that low
level. The whole district suffered under the effects of a
tide-locked, pent-up system of sewerage.</p>

<p>In Greenwich, a very large number of streets were without
main sewers.</p>

<p>In St. Mary, Newington, “the great fact meeting us at
every turn has been the large number of streets without
main sewers therein.”</p>

<p>Rotherhithe, which lay from four to seven feet below high
water, was exceptionally bad. The largest portion of the
parish had no drainage whatever. There were about fifteen
miles of open ditches which had been converted into open
sewers, called in some official documents “Stygian pools,”
and serving “the double debt to pay of watercourse and
cesspool.” Among the ditches “one of the foulest in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
whole neighbourhood of London” was the King’s Mills
stream, about one and a half miles long, which had not been
cleansed for ten years. The sewer in Paradise Row was “in
reality not a sewer,” but “an elongated cesspool a mile in
length,” and during twenty hours daily it was waterlogged.
The very boundary line of the parish for a long distance
was “a wide, filthy, black, open sewer.”</p>

<p>In part consequent on the lack of sewers, house drainage
was either non-existent or fearfully defective. In every
part of the metropolis the evil was evident.</p>

<p>In Clerkenwell the “drainage was either none or very imperfect.
Numberless houses do not drain into the sewers.”
In St. Martin-in-the-Fields, “in the old streets and courts
the drainage was the same as it was when the houses were
built, some as far back as the reign of Elizabeth, and many
in that of Charles I.”</p>

<p>In St. George-in-the-East (1856), “it is astonishing how
few houses have availed themselves of the sewers.”</p>

<p>In Paddington, “the condition of the house-drains is far
worse than that of the sewers. They include every possible
variety of geometrical construction, from a circle to a
square. Some have fallen in; others are choked with
filth.”</p>

<p>In Lewisham (1856–7), “in several places there are
reported to be nuisances of the usual character … cesspools,
no water, &amp;c.—stinking ditches filled with sewage
which can get no further—every abomination, and people
apparently doing what they pleased as regards getting rid of
their filth.”</p>

<p>Nor was it only in the poorer parts of London that the
house-drainage was bad. In St. James’ (Westminster) the
Medical Officer of Health wrote <span class="no-break">(1861):—</span></p>

<p>“For the last two or three years the worst cases of
neglected drainage have not been in houses inhabited by
the poor, but in those inhabited by the wealthier classes
of the community. It is to me frequently a matter of
great astonishment to find how regardless those classes
are, whose circumstances can command every comfort of
life, of the sources of disease and death. This is not only
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
seen in neglect of attention to drainage, but also in the
neglect of ventilation.”</p>

<p>Nor was care being taken to provide drainage even to
houses which were in course of erection. The Medical
Officer of Health for Hackney, which was a growing
district, reported <span class="no-break">(1858–9):—</span></p>

<p>“Building operations have recently been carried on with
considerable activity, numerous new streets have been laid
out and built on…. Unfortunately there have not been,
and there are not at the present time, any means whereby
the construction of proper drainage works could be enforced
before the erection of buildings along the line of new
streets, and the consequence has been that, to avoid the
heavy cost of constructing effective sewers, the drainage
works have been almost everywhere but very imperfectly
carried out, and in many cases not even a brick has been
laid for these purposes.”</p>

<p>The internal condition of the houses was very bad.</p>

<p>In Clerkenwell, where there were over 7,000 houses,
many of them were “quite unfit for human habitation”;
not more than one-third were “in a satisfactory state.”
In Bethnal Green there were “disease-inviting houses”;
in Whitechapel, such was the bad condition of many of
the 2,734 houses which were inspected, that “they ought
to be condemned as unfit for human habitation.”</p>

<p>In St. George-in-the-East, “the sanitary condition of
the dwelling-houses is deplorable.”</p>

<p>Lambeth contained a greater number of inhabited houses
than any other parish in the metropolis—nearly 22,000.
The Medical Officer of Health, after the very limited
inquiry possible within the first year of work, reported
the unwholesome condition of 1,638 of them.</p>

<p>From figures such as these—and they related to only a
tiny fragment of the whole—one can get some measure of
the way the sanitary condition of the houses throughout
London had been neglected, and the indifference of the
owners to the condition of the premises they let.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the vast number of cesspools
which existed in London before the passing of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Metropolis Local Management Act. The investigations
of the various Medical Officers of Health soon demonstrated
that the previous estimates of their prevalence,
and of the disastrous consequences they entailed, had
been in no way exaggerated.</p>

<p>Their disastrous results were at once recognised.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel, in his
report for 1858, <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“I must now direct your attention to the most important
subject, in a sanitary point of view, which can be brought
before you. I allude to the existence of <em>cesspools</em>, more
especially such as are situated either in the cellars of
inhabited houses, or in the small backyards, which are
surrounded by the walls of houses filled with lodgers….</p>

<p>“No cesspool ought to be allowed to exist in London, for
wherever there is a cesspool, the ground in its vicinity is
completely saturated with the foul and putrefying liquid
contents, the stench from which is continually rising up
and infecting the air which is breathed by the people, and
in some instances poisoning the water which is drawn
from the public pumps….</p>

<p>“I am thoroughly convinced by the result of experience,
that the existence of cesspools and overcrowding are the
chief causes of ill-health.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Camberwell <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“… Of all the abominations which disgrace and pollute
the dwellings of the poor, the imperfect, rarely emptied, and
overflowing cesspools are by far the worst … they not
merely poison the atmosphere without, but pour their
emanations constantly, silently, deadly, into the interior
of the houses themselves.”</p>

<p>Upon the quality and supply of the water which was
essential for the life of the people, and upon which their
health, and cleanliness, and sanitation absolutely depended,
the information supplied by the Medical Officers of Health
as to their respective districts brings home, far more than
any general descriptions do, the full import and actualities
of the great evils endured by the people, and the disastrous
consequences entailed upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the water from the surface and tidal wells, which
large numbers of them used and consumed, the opinion,
though expressed in various terms, was unanimous.</p>

<p>From Shoreditch (1860), the Medical Officer of Health
wrote: “I have hardly ever exposed a sample of town
spring water to the heat of a summer day for some hours
without observing it to become putrid.”</p>

<p>In St. Giles’ (1858–9), “the water of the wells was
not deemed good enough (on analysis) for watering the
roads.” In St. Marylebone “44 public wells supplied water
which was for the most part offensive to taste and smell.”
In Kensington (1860) “all the well waters of the parish were
foul.” In Rotherhithe (1857), “The water from the tidal
well smelt as if it had recently been dipped from a sewer.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth declared (1856)
that “the shallow well waters of London combined the
worst features—they represent the drainage of a great
manure bed.”</p>

<p>The people were driven to the use of the water from these
wells owing to the deficient and intermittent supply of
water by the various Water Companies—water supplied
for less than an hour a day by one single stand-pipe in
a court containing hundreds of people—water supplied
only every second and third day, and none on Sundays, the
day of all others on which it was most wanted; and the
house-owners had provided no cisterns or reservoirs of
proper capacity, and the Vestries had not compelled the
house-owners to do so.</p>

<p>In some parishes hundreds of houses had no supply at
all. In some houses which had a supply the tenants were
deliberately deprived thereof by the Water Companies,
because the house-owner had not paid the water-rate.</p>

<p>The defective supply had the disastrous effect of putting a
constant premium upon dirt—dirt of person, of room, of
houses, and their surroundings. And such drains and
sewers as there were, were insufficiently flushed.</p>

<p>Time after time the consequential evils were pointed out,
and Water Companies and house-owners were vigorously
censured. But the censure had little practical effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The great inconveniences and evils, however, evoked
the expression of opinion that the duty of supplying
water to the community ought to be in the hands of the
community.</p>

<p>Even in 1844 it had been pointed out <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>“Water is as indispensable for many purposes as air is
for life itself, and its supply ought not to be allowed to
depend on the cupidity or caprice of landlords or Water
Companies.”</p>

<p>And the Metropolitan Sanitary Association had enunciated
the <span class="no-break">principle:—</span></p>

<p>“That inasmuch as water is a prime necessity of life,
attainable in large cities by combined effort only, and not
to be denied to any without injury to all, its supply should
not be dependent on commercial enterprise, but be provided
at the expense of the community for the common
benefit.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for St. George-in-the
East wrote in <span class="no-break">1856:—</span></p>

<p>“The water supply of your Parish is in the hands of a
Joint Stock Company, called the East London Water
Company, and is managed by persons who represent solely
the interest of the shareholders, whose only anxiety is of
course the dividends—the consumers are not represented at
all. This appears to me to be a strange anomaly, a false
position, and a monstrous inconsistency—as great as if the
sewerage of London were committed to a Joint Stock
Company. But so it is, and however great the danger,
the Vestry has <em>no available</em> remedy whatever in its
hands.”</p>

<p>The principle had been conceded by Parliament so far as
England was concerned—the large cities and even small
towns having been authorised to undertake the supply of
water; but London, the capital, was denied the power to
do so—the duty was given to private companies, and the
population of London was left to undergo untold sufferings.</p>

<p>The quality of the water supplied by most of the Water
Companies after the intakes had been removed to above
Teddington Lock, and the filtration thereof before distribution
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
for domestic use had been made compulsory,
was considerably improved.</p>

<p>But the filthy and dangerous character of the receptacles
provided in many houses for it undid much of the
good which would have come from the improvement in
quality.</p>

<p>The description given by one of the Medical Officers of
Health was in the main <span class="no-break">true:—</span></p>

<p>“There is disease and death in the tanks, wells, and
water-butts.”</p>

<p>Thus, in the great primary necessities of the public health—efficient
sewerage and drainage, decent houses, good
ventilation, pure air, a pure and ample water supply—the
general conditions were almost inconceivably bad.</p>

<p>These evil conditions, however, were far from constituting
the whole of those under which the people of
London suffered.</p>

<p>Over and above them all was one which compelled the
attention of the Medical Officers of Health the moment they
had entered on their duties—“the gigantic evil,” “the
monster evil” of overcrowding. Not the mere crowding of
houses together, evil though that was, but the overcrowding
of people in those houses, and still worse, the overcrowding
of the rooms of those houses by human beings. In every
part of the metropolis there was overcrowding; worst in
the centre, and the parts nearest the centre of London, but
existing in the outer districts where houses still were
comparatively few and population small. Centre, East,
North, West, South, there was overcrowding, differing only
in extent and acuteness of form.</p>

<p>“Soon after I was appointed as Sanitary Adviser to your
Board,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for Holborn
(1856–7), “I found, dwelling in houses which were
undrained, waterless, and unventilated, whole hordes of
persons who struggled so little in self-defence that they
seemed to be indifferent to the sanitary evils by which they
were surrounded.</p>

<p>“It is too true that among these classes there were
swarms of men and women who had yet to learn that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
human beings should dwell differently from cattle, swarms
to whom personal cleanliness was utterly unknown, swarms
by whom delicacy and decency in their social relations were
quite unconceived….”</p>

<p>He mentions some instances too horrible to quote, and
says: “Such were instances that came within my own
knowledge of the manner and of the degree in which
persons may relapse into habits worse than those of savage
life, when their domestic condition is neglected, and when
they are suffered by overcrowding to habituate themselves
to the lowest depths of physical obscenity and degradation.”</p>

<p>In St. Luke “the houses swarmed with their human
tenants.” In Bethnal Green “our crowded streets and
courts are becoming more crowded.” In St. Pancras “in
many houses the overcrowding is very great, each room
being occupied by a family.”</p>

<p>In Islington, so overcrowded were some of the houses
that the Medical Officer of Health had met with as little as
220, 190, 170, down to 135 cubic feet of air available for
each occupant of a room.</p>

<p>In Rotherhithe “almost all the houses were overcrowded
with inmates.”</p>

<p>In Westminster, the Medical Officer of Health gave (in
1858) fifty examples of overcrowding in his district. In one
house, in a room 13 feet long by 9 wide, and 7 feet high,
there were 5 adults and 3 children; and in a lower room in
the same house, 10 feet long by 9 wide, and 8 high, there
were 4 adults and 5 children.</p>

<p>There are no statistics whatever showing even approximately
the number of cases at that time in which a single
room was occupied by a family, but it is certain that vast
numbers of families had to be content with that limited
accommodation. Nor was that even the worst—for, in
very many cases, more families than one lived in a single
room, or the single family took in one or more lodgers.</p>

<p>Life under such circumstances must have been, and
was, awful. The Medical Officer of Health for St. Giles’
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The houses whose rooms are occupied by single families
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
were last year in a condition of squalor and overcrowding
which it is difficult to conceive surpassed….</p>

<p>“In Lincoln and Orange Courts, the most glaring violation
of the laws of health and of the requirements of civilised
life was found. For instance, there are several small rooms
in the backyards of Church Lane…. Each of the rooms
measures about 10 feet by 8, and between 6 and 7 feet high.
Each of them serves a family for sleeping, cooking, and all
domestic needs.</p>

<p>“… The air of these rooms was unbearable to a visitor,
and to open the window was only to exchange one foul
emanation for another.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Clerkenwell wrote
<span class="no-break">(1856):—</span></p>

<p>“In thousands of instances in this district, living,
cooking, sleeping, and dying … all go on in one
room….</p>

<p>“If a poor man gets married he is pretty sure to have
a large family of children, and at the present rate of
mortality several will die of zymotic disease.</p>

<p>“Hence, when a death occurs, the living and the dead
must be together in the same room; the living must eat,
drink, and sleep beside a decomposing corpse, and this in
usually a small, ill-ventilated room, overheated by a fire
required for cooking, and already filled with the foul
emanations from the bodies of the living and their impure
clothes.</p>

<p>“This is an everyday occurrence in Clerkenwell, and
constitutes a formidable evil.”</p>

<p>So great was the pressure for accommodation of some
sort or kind, that even the cellars and kitchens in the
basements of the houses were occupied as dwelling-places
and overcrowded.</p>

<p>In St. James’, “the worst feature of the overcrowding
was the very common practice of residence in cellars or
kitchens. In the majority of cases the places are quite
unfit for human residence.</p>

<p>“… A cellar in St. Giles’,” wrote the Medical Officer
of Health for that district in 1858, “has been the by-word
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
for centuries to express a wretched habitation unworthy of
humanity.</p>

<p>“Dating from the time of Charles I., the underground
dwellings of our district attained the acme of their
miserable notoriety from the pen and pencil of Fielding
and Hogarth.</p>

<p>“… The Building Act of 1844 contained stringent
clauses against the use of such rooms unless they possessed
requisites of area and ventilation, such as were out of the
question in the cellars of St. Giles’.</p>

<p>“The Metropolis Management Act (1855) repeated the
prohibition of 1844, and in defence of the public health the
Board have lately put this statute in force. This has been
done without compromise. As separate habitations for
occupation by human beings at night ‘a cellar in St. Giles’’
is no longer to exist.”</p>

<p>This was written in 1858, but in the following year he
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The profit derived from letting the basement of these
houses as dwelling-rooms was too strong a temptation for
their owners, and many of the kitchens were let again as
soon as the Inspector had reported them emptied.”</p>

<p>In the Strand (1856) underground rooms and kitchens
were inhabited “notwithstanding that District Surveyors
are numerous, and that the Metropolitan Building Act is
in operation.”</p>

<p>In Westminster, “an examination of various portions of
the parishes shows that large numbers of the poor occupy
premises whereby they are not only deprived of the required
quantity of air, but being situated below the level of the
street, the ventilation is insufficient, the rooms generally
damp, and when closed for the night the atmosphere is
perfectly insufferable—mostly kitchens and cellars, evidently
never intended to be used as sleeping rooms”
(1858–9).</p>

<p>The causes of the dreadful overcrowding which existed so
extensively were many and deep-seated—springing from the
very roots of the social and economic system. And they
were of great force and widespread in effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The cause to which the various authorities and Medical
Officers of Health directly attributed it was the one
immediately before their eyes—namely, the pulling down
of houses which hitherto had afforded shelter, of a sort, to
the people.</p>

<p>As the Medical Officer of Health for St. Olave, Southwark,
said <span class="no-break">(1860–1):—</span></p>

<p>“To effect street improvements—to build warehouses, or
for some other purpose—the habitations of the working
classes are broken up without any provision being made for
them elsewhere. They are therefore driven by necessity to
crowd into other houses in the same neighbourhood perhaps
already overcrowded.”</p>

<p>An actual illustration was the case reported by the Medical
Officer of Health for <span class="no-break">Limehouse:—</span></p>

<p>“The London Dock Company have, for the purpose of
enlarging and improving their docks, pulled down not less
than 400 houses in the parish of Shadwell, the homes of not
fewer than 3,000 persons of the poorer classes.</p>

<p>“… The neighbouring parishes are now suffering from
an augmentation of their already overcrowded population.”</p>

<p>The District Board of St. Saviour, Southwark, stated that
the evil of overcrowding “can scarcely be exaggerated,
whether it be regarded in a physical, mental, or moral
aspect.”</p>

<p>The principal of the causes <span class="no-break">are:—</span></p>

<p>“(1) The arbitrary power exercised by railway companies
in ejecting the labouring classes from their homes without
any obligation to provide for their domestic convenience.</p>

<p>“(2) The existing law of (poor law) removal, any break in
the three years’ residence in the parish rendering them
liable to removal to other distant parishes.”</p>

<p>The latter had, however, most probably, but very small
effect.</p>

<p>A great cause was that described by the Medical Officer of
Health for <span class="no-break">Shoreditch:—</span></p>

<p>“There is a constant and rapid flow of population into
Shoreditch. It is in this circumstance that I see one of the
most alarming dangers to the health of the district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“The area does not enlarge, and yet year after year dense
crowds of human beings are packed and squeezed into that
limited area. The growth of the population has far
outstripped the growth of the house accommodation.</p>

<p>“The immense majority of the immigrants are precisely
of that class which most largely increases the dangers of
disease by thickening the population. You are largely
burdened with the pauperism of other and wealthier districts.
The burden is doubly grievous; for it taxes your
property, your labour, and gives strength to the elements of
disease amongst you.</p>

<p>“It is probable that there is no spot in London more
crowded with life than many places in Holywell or St.
Leonard’s.</p>

<p>“Typhus—a disease more terrible than cholera—has made
itself at home in the parish.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Fulham wrote
<span class="no-break">(1857):—</span></p>

<p>“… The daily necessities of the labourer’s family draw
so heavily on his earnings as to leave only a very small sum
for the payment of rent, and hence the most limited house
accommodation is sought for and endured….”</p>

<p>The most powerful cause of all, however, was, undoubtedly,
the overpowering instinct of self-preservation,
or, in other words, the need of working, no matter under
what conditions, for the only means of obtaining food for
themselves and their families. That, as a rule, necessitated
their being near the work to be done—and rather than lose
that work any conceivable hardship or abomination would
be put up with.</p>

<p>Another of the great causes of overcrowding was high
rent.</p>

<p>“It must not be imagined,” wrote the Medical Officer of
Health for the Strand (1858), “that this system of overcrowding
is altogether a direct consequence of a state of
poverty. It certainly does not appear to be so, for among
the Metropolitan Districts the Strand ranks seventh in
order of wealth.</p>

<p>“The overcrowding seems to be partly a result of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
high rental which the houses and rooms of many parts of the
district—so peculiarly well situate for business purposes—command,
and partly of the ‘middleman’ system, in which
so many of the houses in the occupation of the poorer
residents are let.</p>

<p>“The ‘middleman’ system, which obtains so largely in
this metropolis, in the letting of houses of the kind referred
to, is ruinous in its action upon the working classes. The
rent paid for a single room often exceeds a sixth or fifth of
the total income of the family….”</p>

<p>In a case in Bow Street Police Court it was given in
evidence that 21, Church Lane, St. Giles’, was rented of
the owner for £25 a year—that the rents recovered from the
sub-tenants were £58 10s.—and the rents received by these
sub-tenants from lodgers £120 per annum.<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Overcrowding was not confined to the sleeping places of
the people, for the same causes which cramped the available
space for people at night, cramped also the space for very
many of them during the day when they were away from
their so-called homes.</p>

<p>Of the overcrowding in factories and workshops, where so
many of the working classes spent their days, and of the insanitary
conditions in which they there worked, no mention
is made in these earlier reports of the Medical Officers of
Health, not because there were not any, but because the
inspection or regulation of factories and workshops did not
come within the sphere of their duties. Evidence in plenty
there is on this branch of the subject in later years from
those who could speak with authority in the matter, and
it will be referred to hereafter, and that the state of
things then described is equally applicable to this period
is an inference so legitimate as to be tantamount to a
certainty. That the bad conditions under which the
workers worked were a great contributing factor in the
insanitary condition of the people is a fact as to which
there can be no question.</p>

<p>Mention is made, however, of the overcrowding which
existed in another large section of the community—namely,
the overcrowding of children in some of the schools.
The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel reported
that there was much overcrowding, and in his report for
1857 gave some instances of it in his <span class="no-break">district:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>18, <em>Charlotte Street</em>.—In a room 8 feet high, 7 wide,
10 long: 14 children and 1 mistress = 37 cubic feet
each.</p>

<p>17, <em>Charlotte Street</em>.—Matters still worse; the room was
underground; 10 feet wide, 10 long; about 7 feet high;
35 children and 1 mistress = 20 cubic feet each.</p>

<p>2, <em>Gorelston Street</em>.—672 cubic feet; 31 children and
1 mistress = 20 cubic feet each.</p>

<p>In such cases the atmosphere must have been a rapid
poison to those breathing it.</p>

<p>There was another powerful contributory cause to the
general insanitation of London, namely, the defilement
of the atmosphere which people had to breathe. As
one of the Medical Officers of Health said some years
<span class="no-break">later:—</span></p>

<p>“We should remember that the air we breathe is as
much our food as the solids we eat and the liquids we
drink, and as much care should be taken that it is free
from adulteration.”</p>

<p>London was already the greatest manufacturing city in
the world, and the great volumes of smoke proceeding from
the numerous factories undoubtedly deteriorated the quality
of the air. But it was the noxious vapours proceeding from
the various processes of manufacture classified as “noxious
trades” which rendered the atmosphere in many parts of
London dangerous to health.</p>

<p>Many were the descriptions given of the almost intolerable
evils. Thus the Medical Officer of Health for Rotherhithe
reported in <span class="no-break">1857:—</span></p>

<p>“In the mile length of Rotherhithe Street there are no
less than nine factories for the fabrication of patent manure,
that is to say, nine sources of fœtid gases. The process
gives out a stench which has occasioned headache, nausea,
vomiting, cough, &amp;c. Many complaints have been made by
the inhabitants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>From St. Mary, Newington, “the terrible effluvium of
bone-boiling is freely transmitted over the district.”</p>

<p>Some manufacture in a yard in Clerkenwell (1856–7),
which had existed until lately, was “one of the most
abominable, exceeding anything that the imagination could
picture.”</p>

<p>And in every parish or district of London there were
slaughter-houses.</p>

<p>“There are too many slaughter-houses in crowded districts,”
wrote the Medical Officer of Health for St. Pancras
(1856–7). “It is impossible that slaughtering of animals
can be carried on amongst a dense population without
proving more or less injurious to the public health.</p>

<p>“This it does in several ways—by occasioning the escape
of effluvia from decomposing animal refuse into the air and
along the drains, and by the numerous trades to which it
gives rise in the neighbourhood which are offensive and
noxious, such as gut-spinning, tallow-melting, bladder-blowing,
and paunch-cleansing.”</p>

<p>Even in the Strand District there were <span class="no-break">(1856)—</span></p>

<p>“Nuisances arising from various branches of industry, the
slaughtering of sheep and calves in the back-yards, and even
in the cellars and kitchens, and the keeping of cows in the
basements under private dwelling-houses, conditions which
continue to exist in the most crowded parts of this district,
and should on no account be permitted in such a district:”
whilst in Westminster “pig-keeping existed to a very
considerable extent.”</p>

<p>In some of the outer parishes the “fœtid emanations”
caused in the process of brickmaking added to the general
impurity of the air.</p>

<p>There were many other local causes of impurity of the
atmosphere, some even caused by the Sanitary Authorities
themselves. Thus the more thorough scavenging and
removal of the filth of streets and houses, vitally necessary
as that was, resulted in the accumulation of great heaps of
filth in crowded centres.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for Fulham reported
<span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“The collection of dust heaps, and dust contractors’
depôts, constitute a most injurious and offensive nuisance—enormous
quantities of animal and vegetable matter are
heaped together, from which the most noxious effluvia
constantly arise.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Rotherhithe pointed
out (1858) <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>“It is little use causing our own dust to be carted away
if Rotherhithe is to become the receptacle of all the ashes
and offal of a large neighbouring parish (Bermondsey). On
a piece of land near the Viaduct there stands an immense
heap of house refuse, covering an acre of ground at least,
and forming quite an artificial hillock, the level of the
surface having been raised 12–14 feet. The bulk of the heap
is composed of ashes with a due admixture of putrefying
vegetable matter and fish.”</p>

<p>A little later he reports it as 1½ acres in extent, averaging
15 feet high, in one place as high as 20 feet.</p>

<p>How to deal with these noxious or offensive trades was
felt by some of the Medical Officers of Health to be a great
difficulty.</p>

<p>“We have the health of the community on the one hand,”
wrote the Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth; “the great
manufacturing interests on the other…. We have all a
common right to an unpolluted atmosphere, and it is our
bounden duty to withstand any encroachments on that
right. The personal aggrandisement of the manufacturer
must not be achieved by the spoliation of the property, the
comforts, and the lives of his poorer neighbours….</p>

<p>“But the manufacturing interest is not a thing to be
trifled with. Destroy the manufactures of Lambeth, and
you starve its population. There are nuisances of more
benefit than of injury to the community,” and he rather
deprecated “a crusade against those interests, the untrammelled
prosecution of which has raised this country
to its present proud pre-eminence.”</p>

<p>Some of the Medical Officers of Health expressed decided
views on the subject <span class="no-break">(1857):—</span></p>

<p>“Those who follow unwholesome trades led on by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
thirst of gain,” reported one Medical Officer of Health,
“have no right to poison a neighbourhood and swell its
mortality.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for the Strand wrote
<span class="no-break">(1856):—</span></p>

<p>“… The protection of the public health which has
been committed to your charge is, beyond doubt, of infinitely
more importance than, and should far outweigh the
interests of, private individuals how numerous soever they
should be.”</p>

<p>The Nuisances Removal Act, 1855, had given the local
authority power on the certificate of the Medical Officer of
Health to take proceedings against an offender, and had
provided the means for inflicting a penalty. And in some
instances it was used, for the Medical Officer of Health for
Hackney <span class="no-break">reported:—</span></p>

<p>“Several proprietors of noxious trades having omitted to
adopt the best practicable means for preventing injury to
health, in some cases legal proceedings were taken against
them.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel declared
there was no desire on his part to use the powers of the
Act to the oppression of any individual or to insist upon
the adoption of such arbitrary and stringent measures as
shall drive wealthy manufacturers from the district. “All
that is necessary to be insisted upon is that the business be
so conducted that the health and comfort of the inhabitants
shall not be injured.”</p>

<p>But whether it was from the unwillingness of the local
authorities to prosecute, or the difficulties of enforcing the
law, the nuisances continued to the great detriment of the
health of the people.</p>

<p>And over and above this combination of nuisances, there
was the abominable smell from the river. That still was an
evil.</p>

<p>“Rotherhithe,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health, in
July, 1858, “in common with all other metropolitan riverside
parishes, has suffered considerable inconvenience during
the last month from the stenches arising from the filthy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
state of the Thames water. Perhaps in the annals of
mankind such a thing was never before known, as that the
whole stream of a large river for a distance of seven or eight
miles should be in a state of putrid fermentation. The
cause is the hot weather acting upon the ninety millions of
gallons of sewage which discharge themselves daily into the
Thames. And by sewage must be understood not merely
house and land drainage, but also drainage from bone-boilers,
soap-boilers, chemical works, breweries, and gas
factories—the last the most filthy of all…. It is quite
impossible to calculate the consequences of such a moving
mass of decomposition as the river at present offers to our
senses.”</p>

<p>As one sums up all these disastrous influences, or rather,
these evil powers, unceasing in their work, by night and by
day—in the overcrowded dwelling and the street—with their
victims unable to escape, one realises somewhat the conditions
under which great masses of the people of London
were living.</p>

<p>The result was a fearful mortality—an awful waste of
human life.</p>

<p>“Death,” wrote one of the Medical Officers of Health,
“finds easy victims in filthy habits, overcrowded rooms,
impure air, and insufficient and ineffective water supply.”</p>

<p>The consequences were inevitable.</p>

<p>“Wherever there are crowded apartments, imperfect or
no drainage, offensive cesspools, dung-heaps resting against
houses or close to inhabited rooms—wherever ventilation is
impeded by the narrowness of courts and alleys, and wherever
the inhabitants living under these unfavourable circumstances
lose their self-respect, pay no regard to personal
cleanliness, and consider a state of filth and offensiveness
as their natural lot—there we find zymotic diseases in full
force and frequency. Those attacked do not simply recover
or die. I shall not be exaggerating when I say that all recovering
from these complaints are permanently injured.”<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to apportion the respective shares which
these various causes of insanitation had in bringing about
these dire results, but overcrowding was undoubtedly one of
the principal. As to its disastrous effects the Medical
Officers of Health were of one opinion. There was no
single exception to the strong-voiced insistence upon this
fact.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>“The main cause,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health
for the Strand (1856), “to which we must attribute the
high mortality is the close packing and overcrowding which
exists throughout the district…. Overcrowding and
disease mutually act and react upon each other.</p>

<p>“There is one circumstance of general prevalence
throughout the district which, so to speak, almost paralyses
these efforts of sanitary improvement—overcrowding—the
overcrowding of parts of it with courts and alleys, the
overcrowding of these courts and alleys with houses, the
overcrowding of these houses with human beings” (1859).</p>

<p>“The overcrowding of dwellings,” wrote another,<a id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> “is one
of the most frequent sources of sickness and decay at all
ages.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” wrote a third,<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> “there is no single influence
to which a human being is exposed more prejudicial to his
health than overcrowding in rooms the air of which cannot
be perpetually and rapidly changed.”</p>

<p>“No axiom,” wrote another,<a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> “can be more positive
than the connection of epidemic diseases with defects of
drainage and ventilation … the overcrowded localities
being especially scourged by disease.”</p>

<p>The consequences were not confined to epidemic disease;
other fatal diseases were begotten by it.</p>

<p>“All medical writers,” wrote the Medical Officer of
Health for St. James’ (1858), “are agreed that impure air
from want of ventilation is the most potent of all causes
of consumption.”</p>

<p>Not merely directly did overcrowding bring about fatal
results. Indirectly it also led thither. It was recognised
as a cause of intemperance and of the evils, moral as well as
physical, which ensued from intemperance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Men whose nervous systems became depressed, and the
tone of their system generally lowered, became the subjects
of a continued craving for stimulants.”<a id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Simon, Medical Officer of the General Board of
Health, <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“In an atmosphere which forbids the breath to be drawn
freely, which maintains habitual ill-health and depresses all
the natural spring and buoyancy of life, who can wonder
that frequent recourse is had to stimulants?”</p>

<p>The evils were disastrous enough for the adult population,
but they fell with more dire effect upon infants and young
children.</p>

<p>“Conditions more or less injurious to health gradually
impair the matured energies and slowly undermine the fully
developed constitution of the adult; but the self-same conditions,
exerting their baneful influence on the infant or
young child, nip the tender plant in the bud and speedily
destroy its young life.”<a id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Throughout the whole of the metropolis the infantile
mortality—that is, of children under five years of age—was
very great: Almost without exception it was close upon, or
over, 50 per cent. of all the deaths in the various parishes
or districts.</p>

<p>In Clerkenwell the infantile mortality, which was “nearly
one-half of all the deaths,” was characterised as “enormous”;
but in Shoreditch it was actually one-half, being 50 per cent.
(1858); in Bethnal Green it was over one-half, being 52 per cent.
(1858); in St. George-in-the-East it was 53½ per cent.—or,
to put it otherwise, of 1,351 deaths in the year, 720 were of
children under five. In Poplar it was more than half. In
Islington, in 1857, nearly half. In St. Saviour, Southwark,
50 per cent. in 1860–1, “a waste of life which appears almost
incredible.”</p>

<p>In Limehouse (in 1857) of 1,403 deaths 690 were under
five.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“It is when such wretched offspring, ill-nourished, ill-clothed,
and in every way neglected, become exposed to the
depressing influences of an impure atmosphere that they
sicken, and such children when they sicken they die….
When the habitation of such children is an overcrowded,
dilapidated tenement in some close, ill-ventilated court or
alley, furnished with an undrained closet, surrounded by
untrapped drains, and festering heaps of filth, we find ourselves
astonished, not that so many die, but that so many
survive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>In some special places the mortality was still higher.
Thus the Medical Officer of Health for Kensington reports
in <span class="no-break">1856:—</span></p>

<p>“In some places the mortality among infants under five
years of age was at the enormous rate of 61·3 per cent. of the total
deaths.</p>

<p>“One of the most deplorable spots, not only in Kensington,
but in the whole metropolis, is the Potteries at Nottingdale.
It occupies about 8 or 9 acres, and contains about 1,000
inhabitants … the general death-rate varies from 40–60
per 1,000 per annum. Of these deaths, the very large
proportion of 87·5 per cent. are under five years of age.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel (in 1858),
after reporting that the total mortality under five years in
the Whitechapel district is about 56 per cent., <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“How to overcome this frightful and apparently increasing
amount of mortality of the young is a problem well
worthy the attentive consideration of every citizen. The
time may be far distant before this problem is solved;
nevertheless it is my duty to chronicle facts, and although
I may not be able to suggest a remedy to meet this evil,
still the knowledge that so large an amount of infant mortality
does exist in our district—I may say, at our very doors—will
perhaps rouse the attention of the philanthropist, the
man of science, and the man of leisure, to investigate its
cause, and endeavour to mitigate it.”</p>

<p>Once more it must be called to mind that this mortality
was not the whole of the evil, for it was indicative of
widespread infantile sickness and disease among those who
escaped the death penalty—sickness and disease impairing
the health and strength of thousands upon thousands of the
juvenile population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>The facts set forth by many of the Medical Officers of
Health must have enlightened many of the new local
authorities as to the nature and extent of the work which
it had now become their duty to perform, and the grave
problems for which they were expected to find the best
solution.</p>

<p>The earlier annual reports of many of the Vestries and
District Boards were poverty-stricken in the extreme, and
were mostly confined to bald and uninforming tables of
receipts and expenditure, which practically threw but little
light upon the condition of their parishes.</p>

<p>The Vestry of St. Mary, Newington, evidently anxious to
prevent disappointment as to immediate results from its
action, stated <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>“In consequence of the previous want of adequate sanitary
powers in the local authorities of this and other suburban
parishes, so great an extent of sanitary improvement was
required when the Vestry came into operation, that it was
impossible the whole could be dealt with at once, at the
same time acting with consideration for those who have to
bear the effects of many years’ neglect of those sanitary
duties which are now found to be so essential.”</p>

<p>Lambeth Vestry expressed its desire to <span class="no-break">discover—</span></p>

<p>“In what manner a prompt and beneficial execution of
the provisions of the Act can be secured without creating
any serious increase in local taxation.”</p>

<p>One of the Vestries, indeed, gave the quaint explanation
that one of the things which somewhat retarded sanitary
improvement was “the novelty of applying compulsory
powers to landlords.”</p>

<p>The desirability of securing parks and places of recreation
for the people was one of the matters which first appealed
to some of the Vestries and District Boards, and memorials
were addressed to the Metropolitan Board urging the
importance of their putting in force the powers conferred
on them for the purchase of land for such purposes.</p>

<p>Others directed their attention to the promotion in a
small way of improvements in their parishes by widening
streets and roads, and preserving open spaces—towards
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
which, in some cases, they received a contribution from
the central authority.</p>

<p>A good deal of paving was done, and better measures
taken for scavenging the streets and courts, and for the
removal of refuse and dirt of all sorts.</p>

<p>To local sewerage, as distinct from main sewerage, they
also gave attention, and in 1856 designs for 45 miles of
new sewers were sent in to the Metropolitan Board for
approval, and £34,700 borrowed for the purpose; and in
the following year for 46 miles of new sewers, and loans
for £109,000.</p>

<p>A fair amount of drainage work was also carried out—thousands
of cesspools were filled in and drains made. Also
a certain amount of inspection, with the disclosure of an
enormous amount of insanitation.</p>

<p>Thus, in the Strand District in 1856—where 813 houses
were inspected—in 774, or 91 per cent. of these, works
had to be done to remedy sanitary defects. In the following
year 1,760 houses were inspected, and in 1,102 sanitary
defects were found. In Poplar, of 1,299 houses which were
visited, 795 required sanitary improvement. In Paddington
2,201 houses were inspected; in over 1,600 works had to
be executed to put them in sanitary order; figures which
showed that, roughly speaking, two out of every three
houses were sanitarily defective.</p>

<p>“The last year,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for
Hackney (1857)—where 1,518 houses had been connected
with the sewers—“has been a year of drainage.”</p>

<p>Parliament having enacted that the “owner” was
responsible for the state of his property, this work had
to be done at the expense of the owners; but how many
decades had passed in which “owners” had spent nothing
on the property, and had been receiving large rents; and
how many cases of sickness and death had occurred in
their houses, the result of the insanitary condition in which
they had been allowed to fall, and in which they were
allowed to continue.</p>

<p>In Holborn such works cost the owners about £3,400
in 1857, and in Lambeth about £10,700.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>But the work thus chronicled touched little more than
the fringe of the matter. Most of the local authorities
had, out of a spirit of economy, or for some other reason,
appointed only one Inspector of Nuisances; yet in nearly every
one of their parishes there were thousands of houses—in
Greenwich 11,000, in St. Marylebone 16,000, in Lambeth
22,000—and years would have had to elapse before the solitary
inspector could have completed even one round of inspection
and got the houses he inspected put in order; whilst
the others would inevitably have been existing in, or falling
into, a state of insanitation. For years, therefore, the most
vile disease-begetting nuisances might not merely exist
throughout the parish, but work endless evil without any
interference, as indeed they did.</p>

<p>Some of the Vestries put forward their economy as a
claim for praise. Thus, the Wandsworth Board said that
“a due and careful regard to economy had characterised
all their proceedings,” and the Vestry of St. Mary Newington
said, in 1860, that it had carried out its operations out
of current income and had incurred no debt.</p>

<p>The Medical Officers of Health held their offices at the
pleasure of the Vestries, and, therefore, if they valued their
position, had to be cautious in their criticisms of the
management of the affairs of the parishes.</p>

<p>But their reports convey that the work which ought to
have been done was not being done as rapidly as they
wished.</p>

<p>“I wish I could induce the Vestry to insist more upon
having the poorer dwellings cleansed and lime-whited.”
And again, “The Vestry has the power to restrict the
operation of underground rooms, yet it has not moved in
this important matter.”<a id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Giles’ (1857)
referred to <span class="no-break">the—</span></p>

<p>“Indisposition of the Board to do works and charge the
owners”; and, referring to a special case, he wrote, “It
becomes your duty to do something to prevent the production
of disease among the neighbours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Pancras wrote
in <span class="no-break">1856–7:—</span></p>

<p>“In many houses the overcrowding is very great. There
is a clause under the Nuisances Removal Act by which
the Vestry is called on to take proceedings before a
magistrate to abate overcrowding, if it is certified to be
such as to endanger health. No prosecutions have been
taken under this clause.”</p>

<p>And again in <span class="no-break">1859:—</span></p>

<p>“Very little has been done in this parish to abate over-crowding—extreme
cases have been proceeded against. No
systematic efforts have been made in this direction.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Hampstead wrote
<span class="no-break">(1856):—</span></p>

<p>“Nothing short of constant vigilance and inspection can
keep the dwellings and premises of the people in a tolerably
healthy state. I am not sure that your Board is blameless
in some of these respects—an amiable, though weak,
reluctance to act severely to any.”</p>

<p>And in 1857 he pleaded for the appointment of an
Inspector of Nuisances, which, however, he did not get.</p>

<p>The local authorities had their difficulties in dealing with
many of these matters, even when they were disposed or
anxious to do so, owing <span class="no-break">to—</span></p>

<p>“The imperfection of the powers conferred on them by
the legislature, and to the great and stubborn apathy of
a poor population.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for St. James’ (1858)
attributed blame to the public <span class="no-break">generally:—</span></p>

<p>“One of the greatest barriers to the practical efficiency of
sanitary arrangements is the ignorance and carelessness of
the public. It is frequently seen that where infectious
illness occurs, little or no attention is paid to its infective
character, and an unscrupulous intercourse is carried on
between the members of infected families, not only
amongst themselves, but amongst their neighbours, and
thus these diseases are propagated in spite of every
warning and precaution.”</p>

<p>“I regret,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Whitechapel, “that the powers of your Board are not
at present sufficient to compel the owners of small house
property to provide an adequate supply of water for their
tenants.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Westminster <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Few of the objects of sanitary improvement can be
fairly attained without intrenching upon private interests
to an extent which would appear harsh and oppressive.
One great obstacle consists in the habits of a great portion
of the poor—generally deficient in cleanliness or order;
they consider any endeavour to improve their dwelling
as an interference, and throw every obstacle in the way.
On the other hand, a large number are most grateful for
what has been effected.”</p>

<p>But in many matters the local authorities would not take
action. In only four parishes or districts in London had
public baths and wash-houses been established under the
Act of 1846, though where they were in existence “the
benefits were immense by promoting habits of cleanliness.”</p>

<p>In Poplar in 1858–9 nearly 40,000 men, and 3,000
women, and 400 children availed themselves of the baths.</p>

<p>In St. Pancras (1856–7) the laundry department, erected
by the “Society for Establishing Public Baths and Wash-houses,”
was of great value in affording the poor housewife an
opportunity of washing and drying her linen away from her
one room, in which the family had to live night and day.</p>

<p>“I have frequently seen a small room of this kind with
from four to eight or even ten inmates rendered doubly
unhealthy by these laundry operations, which produce a
damp and almost malarious atmosphere.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth had pleaded
for such an establishment in his district, but “the idea of
erecting them seems quite abandoned by the Vestry.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing more objectionable in a sanitary point
of view than the washing of foul clothes in the dwellings of
the poor, and still worse the drying of them in courts and
rooms already deficient of free circulation of air and light.”</p>

<p>Nothing, however, was done. But inaction far greater in
gravity and infinitely more reprehensible was that relating
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
to the housing of the people. The Medical Officer of Health
for Whitechapel drew attention, in his report of 1857, to
their power in this <span class="no-break">respect:—</span></p>

<p>“Docks, railways, warehouses, &amp;c., &amp;c., must be constructed
for the increase of the trade of this great metropolis, but
our construction of them ought not to prevent us from providing
better habitations for the working classes whose
labours effect these improvements; more especially as it is
in the power of parishes by virtue of an Act of Parliament
to encourage the establishment of lodging-houses for the
labouring classes.”<a id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Not one single Vestry or District
Board ever attempted to deal with the evils of bad housing
and overcrowding by putting into operation the provisions
of this Act.</p>

<p>The occasional statement in the report of a Medical
Officer of Health as to what was actually done in his
parish, by showing what might have been done in any
other one, brings into strong relief the incapacity or
deliberate inaction of the local authorities of other parishes.
Thus, in some parishes the Medical Officers of Health
endeavoured to effect some diminution of overcrowding—for
instance, the Medical Officer of Health for Islington
reported <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“In several instances the owners of dwelling-houses had
been summoned for permitting the overcrowding of their
houses; and the magistrate had fined the offenders.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Holborn in the
same year <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Your Board has already done much to ameliorate the
condition of this class of society (the poor and overcrowded)
by compelling the owners to cleanse, drain, and ventilate
their dwellings; to close cellars, to provide proper water
supply, sanitary accommodation, and in many cases had
abated overcrowding.”</p>

<p>But few of the Vestries followed, or attempted to follow,
these examples, and in many of the most vital matters a
deliberate inactivity was the prevailing characteristic of the
Vestries and District Boards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“In several Vestries resolutions were actually moved with
the view of averting the construction of sewers. It was
thought by many persons of influence to be better to live
in the midst of overflowing cesspools than to add to the
defilement of the Thames.”<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The Medical Officers of Health did not confine themselves
to merely reporting what was annually done to ameliorate
the existing state of affairs.</p>

<p>As was their duty, they made numerous and frequent
suggestions to their authorities as to what it was best to
do. And some of them, going further than this, sometimes
endeavoured to inspire the members of the Vestries and
District Boards with a sense of the gravity of their work,
and with lofty views of their duty. Occasionally, even,
they did not hesitate to censure their employers for
inaction or lethargy.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for the Strand wrote
<span class="no-break">(1856):—</span></p>

<p>“To pave streets, and to water roads, to drain houses or
even to construct sewers, however necessary these works
may be, are among the least important of the duties which
devolve upon you. But to improve the social condition of
the poorer classes, to check the spread of disease, and to
prolong the term of human life, while they are works of a
high and ennobling character, are yet duties involving the
gravest responsibility. Should less care be bestowed upon
our fellow creatures than is daily afforded the lower animals?
At the present moment the condition of many of the working
classes is degraded in the extreme.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Saviour, Southwark,
wrote <span class="no-break">(1856):—</span></p>

<p>“In all our efforts at sanitary improvement we are chiefly
dealing with persons who in most instances have not the
power of helping themselves, and who until of late have had
no source to which they might apply for aid in rendering
their dwellings clean and wholesome.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health in St. Pancras <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“All who have made themselves acquainted with the condition
of many of the poor of London will agree with me
when I say that before their moral or religious state is likely
to be remedied, their physical condition must be improved,
and their houses made more comfortable. On you devolves,
to a great extent, the solemn responsibility for carrying out
the preparatory work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Martin-in-the-Fields
wrote to his Vestry in 1858: “To permit such grievous
evils as are to be seen in the worst localities of this great
city is a contradiction to the teaching of Christianity …
such outrages on humanity as many of the abodes of the
poor are permitted to remain.</p>

<p>“It is unholy, it is unchristian, that people should herd
together in such dens; and so long as such dwellings are
allowed to be occupied our assumed religion must be a
pretence and a sham….”</p>

<p>And thus, the Medical Officer of Health for Bethnal
<span class="no-break">Green:—</span></p>

<p>“To open out avenues through our cul-de-sac courts, to
promote the sanitary condition of every house, to arrest by
thorough drainage and removal of refuse the elimination of
aerial poison, are the great duties that we have day by day
to do. Though the task before us be great, the objects in
view are immeasurably greater—to exalt the standard of life,
to economise rates, and above all to decrease the sum of
misery, disease, and death…. To supply the arm strong
to labour, to substitute productive for unproductive citizens,
to decrease the death-roll of the young, and to protract life
beyond the present span, these are the tasks that sanitary
science imposes on us.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Clerkenwell pointed out
<span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“The poorer classes have not the means of remedying
the defective sanitary conditions under which they are
living. But the Vestry has this power.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Pancras made a
calculation that nearly 1,200 deaths in the parish in 1858
were due to causes which might have been prevented by
sanitary improvements. “To every death we may safely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
assume more than thirty cases of illness. This gives us
36,000 cases of preventable disease in the year.”</p>

<p>“You will see,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for
St. James’ (1856), “that by diminishing death and disease,
you are diminishing poverty and want…. The sanitary
question lies at the root of all others. It is a national
one and a religious one. It is true that in the exercise of
your powers you will often be met by the assertion of the
rights of property, but the right of life stands before the
right of property, and it is this recognition of the sacredness
of human life that lies at the foundation of sanitary
legislation.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“I have in this report, as in duty bound, spoken plainly;
if in the opinion of some members of the Board too plainly,
my apology is—the deep sense I entertain of the importance
of sanitary progress; for upon the success that shall attend
the labours of those engaged in this most sacred cause
depends the improvement of the social, moral, and intellectual
condition of the people.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for St. Giles’ made this
pathetic appeal for <span class="no-break">action:—</span></p>

<p>“While you are listening to the remainder of this report,
I trust you will hold in your mind how many lives are
being sacrificed every month to deficiencies in sanitary
arrangements.”</p>

<p>It is only here and there in the earlier reports of the
Medical Officers of Health that specific mention is made of
intemperance, but every reference to the subject showed
how largely “drink” affected the sanitary condition of the
people and intensified and complicated the evil conditions in
which the people were placed, and rendered any amelioration,
physical, moral, or religious, infinitely more difficult.</p>

<p>It was becoming more and more generally recognised that
a very large proportion of the deaths and of disease were
preventable.</p>

<p>“Any skilled eye glancing over the mortality tables will
observe that a considerable number of deaths might have
been prevented.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are now to a great extent aware,” wrote the Medical
Officer of Health for St. Saviour’s (1856), “of the physical
conditions on which the lives of individuals and communities
depend.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Fulham wrote in
<span class="no-break">1857:—</span></p>

<p>“Sanitary science and experience have full clearly proved
to us how great an extent the prevention of disease and its
extension rests with us.”</p>

<p>But against contagion and infection no precautions
whatever were taken, and so disease was sown broadcast
throughout the community, and death followed.</p>

<p>As to suggested remedies and action there was a chorus of
absolute unanimity upon some <span class="no-break">points:—</span></p>

<p>“The principal cause of the extent of zymotic disease,”
wrote the Medical Officer of Health for Mile-End-Old-Town,
in 1859, “is the defective state of the habitations of the
poorer classes. The remedy for the evil is only to be secured
by a systematic house visitation.</p>

<p>“… Without a general house inspection it is impossible
to secure the proper entry to and use of the expensive sewers
which have been and are being constructed.</p>

<p>“Having done so much for the streets, pavements, and
drains, the improvements will lose half their salutary effect
if the interior of the dwellings are not placed in a corresponding
condition of wholesome cleanliness.”</p>

<p>“It is,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel,
“to the interior of the houses that our attention
must be directed, for it is here that the source of disease is
usually found…. An habitual and detailed inspection of the
houses occupied by the poorer classes is therefore essential.”</p>

<p>A house-to-house visitation was, indeed, the first essential.
By no other means could the actual condition of the abodes
of the people be ascertained, and the breeding places of
disease be discovered, cleared out, and rendered innocuous.
And as there was a never ceasing tendency on the part of
the poorer classes to sink into a condition of uncleanliness,
and on the part of their abodes to fall into dilapidation, or,
as it was expressed, “a pertinacity for dirt,” so was constant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
inspection and supervision of vital necessity for the maintenance
of any improvements made.</p>

<p>“There are,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for St.
Pancras (1858), “many parts of the parish densely crowded.
Some of the people have become so used to filth, they appear
to prefer it to cleanliness; at any rate, they have not the
energy to get rid of it and improve their condition. Such
houses—perfect hotbeds of infectious diseases—ought to be
visited two or three times a year….”</p>

<p>The Medical Officers of Health had one valuable object
lesson before them in the common lodging-houses, which,
regulated and inspected by the police under the Acts passed
by Parliament, had shown that even the very worst conditions
of life could be ameliorated, and that the very
lowest and most miserable classes of society were not
beyond improvement.</p>

<p>“The chief points which are regulated by the authorities
(the Police) are cleanliness, drainage and water supply, the
separation of the sexes, and the prevention of overcrowding.
The testimony of all who are acquainted with the dwellings
of the poor is concurrent as to the immense sanitary advantages
gained by the provisions of the Common Lodging
Houses Act, and the results had been to improve in a marked
degree the health, habits, and morals of the persons using
these places.”<a id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>“The cleanliness, comfort, and ventilation of the licensed
rooms in common lodging-houses offer a very marked
contrast to those which are unlicensed.”<a id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>To more than one of these officers the idea occurred that
similar benefits would follow if tenement houses were
similarly inspected.</p>

<p>“I believe considerable good might be accomplished by a
legislative enactment placing every house let out in weekly
tenements to more than one family under similar regulations
to those affecting common lodging-houses, and rendering
landlords liable for permitting overcrowding to exist upon
their property.”</p>

<p>The success of the common lodging-houses was due to the
enforcement upon the owner of the first essentials of sanitation
in the house he let to occupants, and to the regular
“inspection” of his house to secure that those essentials
were maintained in a state of efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was just these two things that were most held in
abhorrence by the majority of tenement-house owners in
London.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for the Strand, after describing
the overcrowding of tenement-houses, wrote <span class="no-break">(1858):—</span></p>

<p>“No remedy it is feared will be found until all houses
of the class alluded to, the rooms of which are let out as
separate tenancies, shall be compulsorily <em>registered</em> under
the supervision of the Local Authority of the District in
which they are situate, as fit for the accommodation of a
certain number of persons, and no more.”</p>

<p>“This suggestion will doubtless excite the sneers of the
ignorant, the fears of the weak, and the ridicule of the
selfish, coupled with the usual expressions about interference
with the liberty of the subject; but the upright and
unprejudiced will not fail to perceive that it is the liberty
and the health of the working classes, forming, as they
do, so large a proportion of the mass of the people which it
is sought to protect from the tyrannical and grasping
covetousness of an avaricious few who care little whether
the health of the working man be destroyed, or whether
his children be reared up in such a way that disease and
vice must almost necessarily result, provided they succeed
in obtaining for themselves an additional percentage upon
their investment.”</p>

<p>And the following year he again forcibly adverted to the
subject.</p>

<p>“When it is borne in mind that in some of the small courts
in this District there are packed together as many persons
as almost equal in number the soldiers congregated in a
commodious barracks, is the high death-rate a matter of
surprise? But what can be done? The authorities, general
or local, cannot surely be expected to provide suitable dwellings
for the people! Undoubtedly they cannot; but it is incumbent
upon these authorities, in the interest of the well-being
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of all classes of the community, to place a prohibitive limit in
regard of overcrowding upon the class of houses the rooms of
which are let out as separate tenements, which would,
without hardship upon their occupants, speedily produce
the desired effect. Such a condition, practically speaking,
already exists in regard of most of the Public Institutions of
this country in which large numbers of persons reside; such
a condition is enacted by law in regard of our emigrant ships:
such a condition is enforced by Act of Parliament in regard
of Common Lodging Houses: and in all these instances the
principle works well. Is it reasonable, then, that in relation
to the influence of over-crowding upon health and life, less
care should be taken of the people who occupy the densely
populated districts of our great towns and cities than is
already provided by law for the inmates of our Common
Lodging Houses, or for the paupers admitted into our Workhouses,
or for the emigrants who leave our shores? Surely
the injustice cannot but be apparent.”</p>

<p>Other suggestions were also made.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel wrote
<span class="no-break">(1859):—</span></p>

<p>“If the public is to enjoy health, and a freedom from the
ravages of epidemic disease, a stop must be put to the present
scheme of erecting houses in crowded situations; for although
the rights of property are to be respected, yet, in my opinion,
such rights are of secondary consideration when compared
with the public health and the increased burdens which must
be borne by the ratepayers to support those whose sickness is
occasioned by the unhealthiness of the localities where they
reside.”</p>

<p>Several urged the vigorous enforcement of the existing
law. To the Vestry of Lambeth the Medical Officer of
Health wrote in his report in <span class="no-break">1856:—</span></p>

<p>“You must proceed actively against those who have raised
the value of their possessions by ignoring the value of human
life, who wilfully multiply disease by neglect of their
pestiferous property.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Hackney wrote <span class="no-break">(1858):—</span></p>

<p>“I feel assured that it cannot be too widely known that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
individuals will not be allowed to deal with their property
in such a manner as to cause injury to the public health.
For although individual liberty has long been the boast of
England, yet there is a point beyond which it cannot be
tolerated with safety; and private good should always be
made to give way to the public welfare.”</p>

<p>The greater the light thrown upon the sanitary condition
of the people of London, the clearer became the fact that the
principal blame therefor rested upon the house-owner, lessee,
or middleman, or as Parliament defined him, “the owner.”</p>

<p>Many of the Medical Officers of Health were outspoken
and unhesitating in their opinion as to the responsibility of
the house-owner for the existing condition of the dwellings
of the people.</p>

<p>“The enemies of the poorer classes,” wrote the Medical
Officer of Health for Clerkenwell, “are the landlords, who
know well that proper lodgings for the really poor do not
exist. They know also that if they buy at a cheap rate any
old premises not fit for a pig-sty and let them cheaply they
will be sure to find tenants.”</p>

<p>If it was not the real owner of the house, it was the
middleman or person or persons between the owner and the
tenant. Rents were high in most parts of London where
there was urgent demand for accommodation, and “the
yearly rental is unfortunately in many cases still further
increased by the ‘middleman system’; many of the houses
being rented by an individual who sub-lets them in separate
rooms as weekly tenancies, and this at an increase of 20 per
cent. <span class="no-break">(Strand 1856):—</span></p>

<p>“And thus it is that health and life are daily sacrificed at
the shrine of gain.”</p>

<p>What sort of property some of them held, and the condition
in which they allowed it to remain, whilst they drew their
“gain” from it, is graphically illustrated by the Medical
Officer of Health in St. Olave’s, Southwark (1856).</p>

<p>He thus described the houses in three small <span class="no-break">courts:—</span></p>

<p>“The whole of these houses are held by one person, and
it is impossible to imagine any state much worse than the
condition of everything connected with their drainage, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here, within a small area, are thirty-nine houses, all
having open foul privies, cesspools all filled, and many
overflowing. The yards are foul, dirty, damp, and
wretchedly paved with small, loose, broken bricks—most
of them are daily filled with the overflowing of the drains
and cesspools, the drains are all untrapped, and scarcely a
house has a proper receptacle for water; they are mostly
broken, dilapidated, uncovered tubs, placed close to the
cesspools, so as to absorb the foul gases emanating from
them. The effluvium on entering any of these places is
abominable, and greatly complained of….</p>

<p>“These three courts are thickly inhabited.”</p>

<p>In the following month he reported nineteen houses in
two streets very much the same as above. In the next
month twenty more—in the month after, thirty more. He
might almost have had the general description printed, with
blanks for filling up the number of such houses and where
situated.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the new Acts passed in 1855, this
condition of things would doubtless have continued indefinitely.
That condition had been reached under absence
of inspection, or regulation, and freedom on the part of the
owner to do as he liked; and had no laws been enacted
to terminate it, no change would ever have been effected.</p>

<p>And when efforts were made by the local authorities
to remedy similar places, strong opposition was met with.
Thus in Hackney <span class="no-break">(1856–7):—</span></p>

<p>“1839 nuisances have been rooted out. In very many
cases prosecutions have been ordered by the Board. They
were almost invariably opposed by the offenders, generally
people of substance, with the advantage of able legal aid,
in the most pertinacious and resolute manner….”</p>

<p>The novelty of enforcing upon the owners the improvements
deemed necessary naturally raised in the minds of
some of the Medical Officers of Health the question as to
the justice of such a proceeding. Those who discussed it
were clear upon the point.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for Shoreditch
(1856–7) <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“The question of putting houses into a condition fit
for habitation has two bearings. It is, <em>first</em>, a question
between the landlords and the tenants, whose health is
sacrificed by neglect. It is, in the next place, a question
between the landlords and the ratepayers.</p>

<p>“If the landlords neglect to make the necessary outlay in
improving their property, the expense of maintaining that
property in its unhealthy condition is thrown upon the
ratepayers, for these have to bear the burden of supporting
the sick and the destitute.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for <span class="no-break">Clerkenwell:—</span></p>

<p>“At present the poor rates are raised by the parish
having to pay the expenses of afflicted poor persons, whose
misery has in most instances arisen from defective
sanitary arrangements, the remedying of which ought to
have been effected at the expense of the landlords, who
derive their substance from the miseries of the poor.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for St. George’s,
Hanover <span class="no-break">Square:—</span></p>

<p>“I am compelled to say that the number of dingy and
dilapidated houses is a proof either that the owners of
house property do not exercise sufficient control over their
tenants, or that they themselves are grievously neglectful of
their duties to their tenants and to society at large. The
health of the Parish should not be allowed to suffer through
the default of either landlord or tenant…. Here there
need be no scruple about interference with private property.</p>

<p>“No man is allowed to sell poisonous food, and none
should be allowed to sell poisonous lodgings, more especially
as the effects of poisonous food are confined to the persons
who eat it—the effects of unwholesome apartments may be
diseases that may be spread.”</p>

<p>On the equity of compelling the owners to put their
houses in order, there are many insisters.</p>

<p>“It is but right,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for
Fulham (1857), “that those who have hitherto fed their
own resources by impoverishing others, should now in their
turn make good the damage.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Poplar (1856), <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“While on the one hand we must not proceed in a
reckless manner so to burden property as to render it
entirely unproductive, yet on the other we cannot allow
the labouring man, whose health is the only property he
can call his own, to live in unwholesome places to the
destruction of that capital, by which alone he is enabled
to support himself and family.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Mile-End-Old-Town
<span class="no-break">(1856):—</span></p>

<p>“… To charge such property (viz., in bad condition
and heavily encumbered) with the costs of thorough repair,
would leave the owners in some instances, I am fully aware,
destitute, but life is more sacred, and possesses higher rights
than property, and it cannot be just to inflict or continue
a public injury while endeavouring to spare and sympathise
with the inconvenience of an individual.”</p>

<p>That the evil state of the dwellings of the poorer classes
entailed a charge upon the public was also pointed out
by the Medical Officer of Health for Bethnal Green, who,
referring to the miserable homes in the parish, <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“From the cradle to the grave their inmates are a direct
charge upon our funds.”</p>

<p>Happily the law was beginning to be enforced, and
beginning to create a little alarm among some house-owners.</p>

<p>“As landlords are now aware that their property will be
visited in rotation by the Inspector, the necessary alterations
and improvements are frequently effected by them in
anticipation.”<a id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Others did the necessary work when ordered to do it
by the sanitary authority.</p>

<p>Others, however, not until legal proceedings were taken,
and they were ordered by the magistrate to do it—and even
then some would not obey the magistrate’s order, and the
work had to be done by the sanitary authority, and the cost
thereof levied from the owner.</p>

<p>One case was recorded by the Medical Officer of Health
for St. Giles’, in 1858–9, in which the authority of the
law was more strongly asserted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>“While speaking of the resistance met with in enforcing
sanitary requirements, it may be here mentioned that the
extreme step of imprisoning the owner of a certain house
has been had recourse to for his obstinate refusal to comply
with a magistrate’s order.”</p>

<p>That disease and sickness among the people entailed a
great loss and heavy burden upon the community appears
scarcely to have received any recognition up to this, and yet
it was a truth of far-reaching importance. That individuals
suffered was of course clear, but that the community did
was by no means realised.</p>

<p>Several of the Medical Officers of Health promptly
discerned how true it was, and in their earlier reports dwelt
upon it, pointing out the effects, and emphasising their
great importance.</p>

<p>“It cannot be too often impressed upon our minds,”
wrote one, “that sickness among the poor is the great
cause of pressure upon the rates; and everything that will
tend to diminish the number of sick will be so much saved
to the ratepayers.”<a id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>“The greater the amount of disease,” wrote another,
“the larger the proportion of pauperism.”</p>

<p>“Of the causes of pauperism, none are so common as
disease and death,” wrote another.</p>

<p>Indeed, a little consideration must have demonstrated
its truth. Difficult as it was for the individual in health
to earn a livelihood—when sickness fell upon him there was
the instant and complete cessation of his wages, and there
were expenses incurred by his sickness. If he recovered,
there had been a long disablement from work, and a heavy
loss. If, however, he died, the community suffered by the
loss of his productive labour, and, where the victim was the
breadwinner of a family, his widow and children but too
commonly became a charge upon the rates.</p>

<p>“High mortality in a district,” wrote the Medical Officer
of Health for Clerkenwell (1858), “especially among the
poor who are the principal sufferers, does not relate simply
to the dead; the living are also deeply concerned. Every
death in a poor family causes an interruption to the
ordinary remunerative labour, and produces expenses which
have to be paid out of scanty wages. Hence the living
suffer from want; the parish funds must be appealed to;
families become parentless, and next comes crime.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel (1858)
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“In the course of time the public will learn that sickness,
with its concomitant evils, viz., the loss of wages, the calls
upon clubs and friendly societies, the increased amount of
charitable contributions, a heavier poor rate, &amp;c., entails
more expense upon the community than would be required
to carry out sanitary improvements in widening streets,
converting the culs-de-sac into thoroughfares, and in erecting
more commodious houses for the poor.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for the Strand
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Of every death which occurs in this district over and
above the ordinary rate of mortality, the number of <em>cases
of illness in excess</em> must be a high multiple. And during
every attack of severe illness the patient, whatever his
position in life may be, must be maintained—if wealthy,
at his own expense, if poor, at that of the community at
large. And in the latter case, the community at large must
thus suffer a direct loss. <em>Health is money</em>, as much as time
is money, and sooner or later sickness must be paid for
out of the common fund….”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Shoreditch (1856)
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“To communities as well as to individuals there is
nothing so expensive, so fatal to prosperity, as sickness.
To a productive and labouring community, health is the
chief estate…. A community is but a system of
individuals—if one portion of that system be disabled by
sickness, every other portion will feel the blow; the whole
community will be taxed to support that part which is
rendered incapable of supporting itself. It is then a plain
matter of self-interest, as well as of solemn obligation, to
exercise the most vigilant care in preserving to the poor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
their only worldly possession, their health and capacity for
self-support.”</p>

<p>Nor did the danger to the great community of London,
from the prevalence of sickness in any particular district,
appear to have received the faintest recognition.</p>

<p>And yet, in the matter of health, and protection from
infection, all classes from the highest to the lowest had
equal interest; for disease commencing or raging in one
district is not long in spreading to other districts.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Chelsea (1857–8)
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“It cannot need any argument to prove that diseases
of an epidemic or infectious nature cannot be arrested in
their progress by the imaginary line drawn around the
boundaries of the parish—that the smoke from the furnaces
in Lambeth and Vauxhall must be wafted across the
Thames and influence the health of the inhabitants of
Chelsea, if not kept in check, and that evils of minor
importance in Pimlico, on one side, and Kensington on
the other, may be quite as prejudicial to the health of the
neighbours residing on this side of the boundary as to those
among whom they are generated.”</p>

<p>That any one locality had a duty to its neighbours, still
less to London as a whole, as well as to the people of its
own area, was beyond the range of the ideas of the vestries
and district boards. Indeed, if their sense of duty did not
induce them to look after and safeguard the people for
whose sanitary condition they were immediately responsible,
how could it be expected of them to be influenced by
considerations as to those residing outside their area, and
residing many miles away.</p>

<p>And yet, by the very condition of things, this greater
responsibility did exist.</p>

<p>But the great fact that in the vital matter of the public
health London was one great community, the various parts
thereof being indissolubly welded together into one great
whole, had not as yet apparently dawned upon the minds of
the newly-created local authorities; nor, indeed, had Parliament
even realised it, for it had left the forty and more of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
those authorities full freedom to scatter disease of the
deadliest type from one end of London to the other, and to
imperil the lives of London’s inhabitants.</p>

<p>The reports of one of the Medical Officers of Health give
such an exceptionally complete and vivid description of the
condition of the parish to which he had been appointed, and
in which he worked, that a series of extracts from them are
given.</p>

<p>The parish was the parish of St. George-the-Martyr in
Southwark, on the south side of the river, just opposite the
City; “low-lying and flat, and about half a foot below
Trinity high-water mark,” with an area of 282 acres, and a
population of about 52,000 persons, and the Medical Officer
of Health was Dr. William Rendle, who speaks of himself
as “an old parish surgeon.”</p>

<p>“If a loose drain conducts stenches into a man’s house
instead of out of it, if the concentrated filthiness of a gully
is blown into a front door or window, if a house often visited
with fever has not been cleansed or whitewashed for many
years, if there is no water but putrid water filled with disgusting
living creatures, and no butt except a rotten one,
not even the most enthusiastic lover of things as they are
can find fault with us if we try to alter these things for the
better….</p>

<p>“Let us picture to ourselves the man of the alley come
home from work.</p>

<p>“The house is filthy, the look of it is dingy and repulsive,
the air is close and depressing; he is thirsty: the water-butt,
decayed and lined with disgusting green vegetation, stands
open nigh a drain, and foul liquids which cannot run off are
about it, tainting it with an unwholesome and unpleasant
taste; the refuse heap with decaying vegetable matter is
near, and the dilapidated privy and cesspool send up heavy,
poisonous, and depressing gases. Such are the homes, may
I say, of thousands in this parish?”</p>

<p>He contrasts the public-house with that, and says: “The
surprise is not so much that one man here and there reels
home drunk and a savage, as that for every such a one there
are not twenty. Gentlemen of the Vestry who have seen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
these things can bear me witness that I do not exaggerate.
This is no fancied statement….</p>

<p>“This parish has always been remarkable for its deathly
pre-eminence. Hitherto there has been no sufficient law.
After this we shall stand without excuse….</p>

<p>“… Who is to say, when the question is improvement,
as to where we shall stop? No doubt there is a question of
more or less rapid progress, so as to hurt existing interests
as little as may be….</p>

<p>“Our intrusive visits, as some would call them, into filthy
and diseased houses, benevolent as they are, on behalf of
those who cannot always help themselves, have example
even in the most remote times and from the highest
authority. The ancient authority was more imperative, and
made it more a matter of conscience. In the ancient
Jewish law it was ordained ‘that he that owneth the
house shall himself come and tell the Priest, saying: “It
seemeth to me there is, as it were, a plague in the house.”’
The Priest was then to command the emptying it, so that
“all in the house be not made unclean.” He was then to
cause it to be scraped within and about, and finally he
was to pronounce when the house was clean, and might be
again inhabited.</p>

<p>“The Priest was, you perceive, the Medical Officer of
Health under the Jewish law, and this text of Leviticus is
the 13th section of the Diseases Prevention Act….</p>

<p>“From what I see of the parish we cannot without inconveniently
close packing hold many more.<a id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>“The growth of our parish is not from births alone; some
persons of course immigrate from other parts of England,
but the greater part come from Ireland, bringing with them
disease and poverty….</p>

<p>“I am afraid that the poor of other parishes are forced
upon us. We increase in poverty, and, paradoxical as
it looks, the poorer we get the more we shall have to
pay.</p>

<p>“There are now from 6–7,000 cases of illness per year
attended by the poor-law surgeons.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
<p>“Our poor work at the waterside, in the city, and at the
docks; their productive labour helps to pay the rates of other
parishes, but in difficulty and sickness they live and lean
upon us.</p>

<p class="p1">“Our parish is now almost completely built over.</p>

<p>“In 1850, out of 1,169 deaths 565 (or one half) were under
5 years.</p>

<p>“In Bermondsey, 506 out of 983.</p>

<p>“Our parish and Bermondsey are quite ahead (of others)
in this unenviable race towards death.”</p>

<p>“The contents of our sewers can only be discharged 4
hours each tide—8 hours each day—the remaining 16 hours
daily they are reservoirs of stagnant sewage.”</p>

<p>“We are sadly deficient in sewers. At least 100 courts,
alleys, and back streets are entirely without drainage….
Some of our sewers have remarkably little incline. That
in Friar Street, a most important one, is so level from
Bean Street to Suffolk Street that it has a most curious
quality for a sewer, that of flowing either way equally
well.</p>

<p>“One very prevalent evil is loose brick drains which let
the deadly gases into houses.”</p>

<p>“… We are a most melancholy parish, low in level
and low in circumstances. The lowest and poorest of
the human race drop from higher and richer parishes
into our courts and alleys, and the liquid filth of higher
places finds its way down to us. We receive the
refuse as well as the outcomings of more happily situated
places.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>His report for 1857 continued his <span class="no-break">description:—</span></p>

<p>“We lose annually 30 per 1,000—there are only two
parishes worse than we are. Some at least of this mortality
is preventable. If we could keep to the average of all
London we should lose 300 less a year; or even to that of
Bethnal Green we should lose 200 less.</p>

<p>“Few people believe we are so bad as we really are, and if
we do not believe we shall not of course try to mend it, but
it cannot be denied.</p>

<p>“The rich Londoners pay a low poor-rate. The poor
Londoners pay a high poor-rate. This bears hardly upon
us; it stifles us: more and more packed, more and more
impoverished; with very little space between the poor ratepayer
and the pauper, there is more sickness and death.</p>

<p>“Density of population brings you more deaths, more
sickness, more expense.</p>

<p>“The dreadfully vitiated air of our courts and close rooms
produces and fosters consumption.”</p>

<p>Commenting on the common lodging-houses, he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The police regulations for order, cleanliness, and prevention
of disease are in the highest degree satisfactory….
The benefits are so great that the employment of the same
regulations in the more crowded and filthier houses of the
poor can only be a question of time. It is the highest
humanity to quicken the progress.</p>

<p>“Vestries have power sufficient for the purpose. The need
is so great, so undoubted by those who have seen the evils
with their own eyes, and the benefit to be obtained so
certain, that if the local authorities do not enforce the improvements,
the police will have to do it.</p>

<p>“As to the overcrowding, I have brought many cases before
you, each from illness resulting in difficulty of cure, constantly
recurring. ‘I can never get out of that house,’ said the
district surgeon of one of them. The eight rooms in this
house were always full, the receipts £2 2s. a week, yet it
was dirty, neglected, and overcrowded. So the poor live,
and I may say, so they die.”</p>

<p>“As to some manufactories, some of them are very bad,
and their pernicious influence spreads widely. I do not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
think any manufacturer should be obliged to leave; trades
must, of course, be protected; but one man must not, to
save a little expense in his building and machinery, be
allowed to poison a neighbourhood, containing as this does
some 30,000 people.</p>

<p>“There are various ways of making almost all of them
bearable.”</p>

<p>“In this parish are at least 4,000 houses rated under £10
a year, and containing 30,000 persons.”</p>

<p>1858. <span class="no-break"><em>1st Quarter:</em>—</span></p>

<p>“Of smallpox and vaccination there are some who neglect
this great precaution, and so not only imperil themselves but
others. Here is the evil, and indeed, I believe, the reason
why the disease is not altogether banished.”</p>

<p>“… A case registered as diphtheria occurred and
died; it began in one of the very worst localities and then
extended to opener and better places. Thus it is that
modern society neglects the social condition of its poor, and
the poor with a well-ordered revenge bring disease and
death as a consequence.”</p>

<p>Referring to some tables he compiled, he <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“In this table appear 42 deaths from consumption; it
has but recently become prominent how very preventable a
disease this is … the principal causes have here been
made obvious enough: sleeping closely in ill-ventilated
rooms, overcrowding, and bad ventilation.”</p>

<p>“It is now quite established that, with close overcrowded
rooms—that is, by assiduously causing the continued breathing
a tainted atmosphere—you may insure consumption in
the most healthy.</p>

<p>“3,500 years ago the Jewish legislator promulgated laws
and duties almost identical with those we are now engaged
in carrying out as new in the nineteenth century—but so
it is.”</p>

<p>“… There is a great deal of carelessness touching human
life, and a great want of common sense or serious thought
in the preserving it. Much is left to chance. There is
either fatalism or stolid indifference upon the matter pervading
highest society, and the poor, driven as they are from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
richer districts into poorer neighbourhoods, can scarcely
help themselves; they lose at last all healthy communication
with richer or better neighbours, and all taste for pure
air and healthy pursuits; they pack close, they descend a
little, often a great deal, toward the lower animals, and so
live neither for this world nor the next.”</p>

<p>“There are 7,000 houses in this parish. 890 of these
have been visited this year, and in 756 the work ordered has
been carried out—sometimes in a most slovenly manner—an
apparent compliance with your orders. In the poorer
districts the most incompetent men are employed to plaster
over, patch over, whitewash, or cover over the evils ordered
to be <em>not covered but amended</em>. Still a great amount of
good work has been done.</p>

<p>“… Overcrowding is the normal state in our poorer
districts. Small houses of four rooms are usually inhabited
by 3 or 4 families, and by 8, 16, or 24 persons, <em>e.g.</em>, 133
inhabitants in 8 houses … a filthy yard generally implies
a filthy house and unclean habits” … “this parish with
its thousands of refuse heaps.”</p>

<p>“I know that we are on the right track. May Pole
Alley, a cul-de-sac with its 23 houses and 180 people,
was once a nest of infectious diseases. I attended some
10 cases of typhus there, some of them malignant enough
to destroy life in 48 hours. With great trouble this court
has been cleansed and amended. It is very much more
healthy.”</p>

<p>1858. <span class="no-break"><em>2nd Quarter:</em>—</span></p>

<p>“June—an exceedingly hot and dry month. You may
judge of the effect of such temperature upon exposed
dung-heaps, wet sloppy yards, and rotten, filthy, uncovered
water-butts; three characteristics of this parish….</p>

<p>“The Surgeon of the District writes thus to the Board of
Guardians: ‘The smell is very bad from a horse-boiling
establishment in Green Street, which causes a great increase
of sickness near that part.’ This of course refers to the
bone boiling and other like establishments, of which there
are, in this one small street, three cat gut manufacturers,
one soap boiler, one horse slaughterer, and four bone boilers—all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
very offensive trades. I am receiving complaints in
all directions as to this matter. I am inclined to think that
this is not altogether just to the 20,000 inhabitants who live
within the effluvia circle of Green Street.”</p>

<p>As to infantile mortality he writes: “I confess I see but
little difference between that sanguinary ancient law that
directly destroyed weakly and deformed children, and that
modern indifference that insures at the very least an equally
fatal result” … “these disturbing truths involving so
much trouble and expense, and giving us painful reminders
of new duties, as well as of old ones neglected.”</p>

<p>He complains of having to neglect a great many cases of
insanitation owing to want of staff. “… Of those upon
whom orders come to remove nuisances, &amp;c., a large number
are objectors, and not a few positive obstructors….”</p>

<p>“The items in this last table merit attention, and throw
a sad sort of light upon the condition of the poor of this
parish. We have visited 73 unclean and ruinous houses;
118 in which the water was stored in a most unwholesome
manner; 163 in which the drains were defective enough to
be disease producing; 72 in which the w.c.’s were more or
less unfit for use; 110 yards sloppy, not paved, or ill-paved;
and 138 in which there was no sufficient provision for house
refuse….</p>

<p>“We are packing more and more closely.</p>

<p>“In the great mass of our poorer habitations the allowance
of breathing room is not more than 200 cubic feet per head—often
as low as 120. In one house reported to me there
were 30 in four rooms with only 2,410 cubic feet, or
80 cubic feet per individual. This must, of course, be premature
death to many of them….</p>

<p>“We cannot overlook what is going on: improvements are
being effected elsewhere, the dwellings of the poor are being
destroyed, a few parishes are fast becoming pre-eminently
poor, over-crowded, and filthy. I need not tell you that this
parish is one that gets in this respect steadily worse from
the improvement in others.</p>

<p>“The temptation is very great to overcrowd; the poor
family, however large, by crowding into one room, and by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
even taking a casual lodger in addition, obtains a sort of
home at a cheaper rate, and the owner gets a much larger
revenue out of what I must, I suppose, call human habitations.
The resulting illness and death are considered inevitable,
or are viewed with a stolid indifference.”</p>

<p>1858. <span class="no-break"><em>3rd Quarter:</em>—</span></p>

<p>Of the greatness of the mass of prevalent evils he
wrote: “I have often reported it here, but the very
enormity of the evil blunts our appreciation of it….”</p>

<p>There had been a high mortality in the Quarter. “We
are once more, I believe, the worst parish in London….”</p>

<p>“The back districts of this parish require relief, as much
as Ireland ever did, from a class of middlemen who, with
some few most honourable exceptions, grind out all they can
from the most squalid districts, and carry nothing back in
the way of cleanliness or improvement.”</p>

<p>He gives a long list of streets and courts and places where
disease was rampant and deadly owing to the insanitary
conditions.</p>

<p>“It may perhaps be said that all this is in the order of
nature, and cannot be prevented. My experience of a
quarter of a century among these diseases points quite the
other way. Providence does not intend that reservoirs of
stinking putrid matter shall stand so close to the poor man’s
door as to infest him at bed and board…. In the Jewish
scriptures the places for the purposes here mentioned are
ordered to be without the camp, as far from the breathing
and eating places as possible; and among us, as you see,
when we tolerate such abominations, He visits us with
death. It is the result of the irrevocable laws of nature
often averted by what appear as happy accidents, but at
last, when disregarded, deadly. Gentlemen, you are the
trustees for life and death to a population of well-nigh
30,000 people, who from the force of circumstances are more
or less unable to help themselves….”</p>

<p>“Of course it cannot be expected that we can provide the
homes of the poor with the orderly arrangements and benefits

the improvements we can easily achieve, and which a wise
legislature has given us full authority to do.”</p>

<p>“Total deaths in Quarter ended October 2nd, 1858—369,
of which 225 were of children under 5 years = 61 per
cent!!”</p>

<p>The whole tone of this report was such that he could not
possibly continue as Medical Officer of Health to a then
existing Vestry, and he resigned.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by another very able man, Dr. Henry
Bateson, from whose reports may be continued the description
of this parish up to the census of 1861.</p>

<p>“The onward moral and intellectual progress of the
human race depends far more upon the sanitary state which
surrounds it than has ever yet entered into our imaginations
to conceive….</p>

<p>“We have suffered severely from the ravages of smallpox.
Smallpox is a disease over which we have perfect control,
and which, were vaccination thoroughly carried out, might
be banished from these dominions.”</p>

<p>“… Men whose nervous systems become depressed
and the tone of their system generally lowered, become the
subjects of a continued craving for stimulants.”</p>

<p>“… Our wells are but the receptacles of the washings
from our streets, the off-scourings from our manufactories,
the permeations from our cesspools, and the filterings from
our graveyards.”</p>

<p>1860–1861. After five years’ local <span class="no-break">government:—</span></p>

<p>“The circumstances are various and complicated, which
contribute to prevent the improvement of the district, and
even make the endeavour seem at times hopeless. No one
can know the fertile sources that exist for producing in
the mind this feeling of despair save those engaged in sanitary
labours; or those perchance whose duty it may be to
visit our poorest and lowest localities.” … “It is no light
and easy work to remove the aggregate evils of centuries
which, like the coral reefs of the ocean, have grown up
silently and continuously to their present magnitude….
There are hindrances all around, some of which are unsurmountable,
such as those arising from the imperfections of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the law itself … there are also vested rights, customs,
ignorance, stupidity, and avarice, all of which have to be
dealt with and overcome if possible.”</p>

<p>“Nature never pardons. Obey and it is well; disobey
and reap the bitter consequences.”</p>

<p>Referring to some houses “of the worst description,
having no yards, nor even windows behind, so that ventilation
was impossible,” he says: “I am sorry to say that there
are numbers of similar houses still standing, and occupied
by the most ignorant and degraded of our population—a class
living almost in the neglect of laws human and divine; and
as heedless about the present and the future as the very
heathen themselves….”</p>

<p>“The state and condition of the dwellings of the poorer
classes are a stain upon our civilisation.”</p>

<p>“… No one can conceive, nor would they believe,
unless eye-witnesses, the wretched circumstances in which
vast numbers of families have to spend their lives. It is
indescribable.”</p>

<p>“The daily task of keeping clean their houses and families,
once a pleasure to them as well as a duty, having to be
performed amid overwhelming obstacles on every side,
from which no hope of escape remains to cheer them
on, is gradually neglected and ultimately abandoned, their
spirits become torpid and depressed, and this is necessarily
followed by the derangement of the functions of the body.
Finally they become reckless, and this recklessness increases
the evil which gave it birth. There is action and reaction.
What marvel then that, like unto those about them, they
float down the ebb tide towards the dead sea of physical dirt
and moral degradation. It has been truly said by Dr.
Southwood Smith, ‘The wretchedness being greater than
humanity can bear, annihilates the mental feelings, the
faculty distinctive of the human being.’”</p>

<p>“The heedlessness shown in the building of houses is
astonishing. No care is taken about the nature of the subsoil,
the position, the ventilation, and means of cleanliness.
They are run up anywhere and almost anyhow, and too
often become the prolific source of disease.” And he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
quotes: “No man has a right to erect a nuisance, and
the public has clearly as good a right, as great an interest
in enforcing cleanliness to prevent the outbreak of an
epidemic as in requiring walls to prevent the spread of
fire. Yet, where one is destroyed by fire, how many
thousands are there destroyed by disease, the indirect result
of such erections?”</p>

<p>“We are desperately careless about our health, and
apparently esteem it of small value. A great modern
writer has truly said: ‘The first wealth is health. No
labour, pains, temperance, poverty, nor exercise that can
gain it must be grudged. For sickness is a cannibal which
eats up all the life and youth it can lay hold of, and absorbs
its own sons and daughters.’”</p>

<p>The descriptions here given enable us to realise how
terrible and pitiable a state of things had been reached,
and the depths of filth, and misery, and abomination into
which the people had been allowed to sink through the
indifference of Parliament, the absence of any local
government, and the neglect or avarice of the “owners.”</p>

<p>One hope there now was. Parliament had at last
made laws to remedy these evils, and local governing
authorities had been created to administer and enforce the
laws.</p>

<p>In 1858 a Public Health Act was passed by Parliament,
which put an end to the existence of the Board of Health,
and transferred to the Privy Council the administration of
the Diseases Prevention Act. And the Privy Council was
authorised to cause inquiry to be made in relation to
matters concerning the public health. In 1861 a medical
department of the Privy Council was formed which has in
many ways been of immense service to the cause of public
health, and which, as time went on, developed towards
a true Ministry of Public Health.</p>

<p>All things considered, by the end of the first five years
of the working of the new local constitution conferred upon
the metropolis, a real beginning had been made in the
sanitary evolution of the great city. Some of the grossest
evils had been attacked, and a start made in lifting London
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
out of the depths of the appalling slough of abominable filth
in which it had become submerged.</p>

<p>In some of the vitally important matters progress was
material. The improvement in the water supply was
considerable, the main drainage works had been started;
the construction of many new sewers, the abolition of great
numbers of cesspools, and the better drainage of houses,
were all events of a decidedly satisfactory character.</p>

<p>And the death-rate of London as a whole showed a slight
decrease—from 23·38 per 1,000 in 1851 to 23·18 in 1861.
In some districts there was an increase—in the majority,
however, there was a decrease.</p>

<p>But most encouraging of all was the direct evidence
afforded by experience as to the effects of sanitary improvements.</p>

<p>Thus, in Whitechapel, the Medical Officer of Health, in
reporting that the cases of fever had diminished from 1,929
in 1856 to 190 in 1860, <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“This diminution may be fairly attributed to the
additions made to the sewerage of the district, the improvements
effected in the drainage of 2,172 houses, the abolition
of 3,002 cesspools, the better paving of many of the courts,
the systematic inspection, &amp;c., of houses where fever
occurred, the removal of 37,607 nuisances, and to the
abolition of several offensive trade nuisances.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Shoreditch wrote,
in <span class="no-break">1861:—</span></p>

<p>“That the diminished mortality and the lesser frequency
of epidemic diseases are really due in great measure to
sanitary works and inspection is proved by the diminution
and even disappearance of certain forms of sickness from
streets, courts, and districts where sewers have been
constructed, ventilation provided, and other improvements
effected; whilst, on the other hand, the districts still
requiring those necessary reforms furnish far more than
their proportion of the epidemic sickness and mortality.”</p>

<p>Philanthropic individuals were increasing their efforts for
the improvement of the people; and societies, working on a
self-supporting basis, were taking more active interest in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the housing problem, and erecting model lodging-houses
and more healthy habitations.<a id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Public opinion was more interested than before in
sanitary matters, and it was thought that the working
classes had also in some degree awakened to the care of
their own health.</p>

<p>“Altogether,” wrote the Registrar General, in his report
on the health of London after the census figures of 1861
were known, “there is abundant proof of that increased
regard for human life that attends civilisation.”</p>

<h2 class="chaptHead"><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">1861–1870</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> Census of 1861 disposed of the various estimates of the
population of London, and of the death-rates in its various
parishes, and gave authoritatively the actual figures.</p>

<p>From 2,363,341 persons in 1851, the population had gone
up to 2,808,494 in 1861—an increase not very far short of
half a million; and the number of inhabited houses had
increased from 306,064 to 360,065.</p>

<p>The natural growth of the population, or in other words,
the excess of births over deaths, accounted for but part
of this increase. The rest was due to the great stream
of immigrants into London, which, notable previously,
“continued to flow thither with unabated force.”</p>

<p>The increase was not equally distributed. The population
of the central parts showed a decline. There the great
economic forces were most powerful, and under their
influence the population of the “City” had decreased by
more than 15,000: that of Holborn and St. Martin-in-the-Fields
by nearly 2,000 each: that of St. James’, Westminster,
by about 1,000, and two or three others slightly.</p>

<p>But elsewhere—east, north, west, south—the increases
had been great, and in some instances remarkable. Poplar
had increased in the decade by 32,000; Islington by 60,000;
St. Pancras by 32,000; Paddington by 29,000. And on the
south side of the river, Wandsworth had increased by
20,000; Newington and Camberwell by 17,000 each; and
Lambeth by 23,000.</p>

<p>The rate of growth in the various wards or parts of the
parishes showed, both as regarded persons and houses, great
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
differences, the most rapid increases being in the parts
nearest to the centre of London.</p>

<p>A most material factor in the sanitary evolution of any
great city, and especially so of London, is the introduction
into its population of fresh elements from the outside.</p>

<p>The returns collected by successive Census Commissioners
gave considerable information upon this point.</p>

<p>“London is the metropolis of the Empire,” wrote the
Commissioners of 1861, “and thither the representatives of
other nations, of the Colonies, and of Scotland and Ireland
resort; but it is chiefly the field in which the populations of
the several counties of England find scope for their talents
and their industry.”</p>

<p>The majority of the inhabitants of London in 1861 were
indigenous, for 1,701,177 were born within its limits;
1,062,812 were born elsewhere.</p>

<p>Of these 1,062,812, close on 36,000 were born in Scotland,
107,000 in Ireland, 19,000 in the Colonies, and 48,000
were foreigners. The remainder—amounting to about
893,000—were born in the extra-metropolitan counties of
England and Wales.</p>

<p>“Proximity to the metropolis, and the absence of manufactures
at home, first drew the natives of these counties to
London. The stream of immigrants from the south-western
counties was large: Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset,
and Wiltshire having sent 128,422 of their natives to be
enumerated in London.”</p>

<p>Likewise the stream from Norfolk and Suffolk was large.
But the great bulk of the immigrants came from the
counties immediately around London.</p>

<p>To put the figures in simple form—of every 1,000
inhabitants of London, 606 were born in London, the
remaining 394 were born elsewhere.</p>

<p>And the census provided also the means for ascertaining
as correct a death-rate as could be arrived at. In 1851 the
death-rate was 23·38 per 1,000; in 1861 it was 23·18—not
much of a decrease, but satisfactory in showing that some
of the evil powers of insanitation were stayed.</p>

<p>It is, however, always to be borne in mind that either
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the death-rate, or the number of deaths, gives but an
imperfect and incomplete picture of the sanitary condition
of a population. It tells but the tale of those who have
died of disease—it leaves uncounted and untold the far
greater number of those who have been either temporarily
disabled or maimed for life by disease. Estimates vary
considerably as to the number of persons who suffer from
disease and recover; and the proportion of recoveries to
deaths varies in different diseases, some diseases being so
much more deadly than others. But the sick-rate is always,
and under all circumstances, very much greater than the
death-rate.</p>

<p>The mere taking of a census could have no visible or
actual effect; the routine of life and the action of the
various economic and social forces continued unchanged;
but the information gained was of the utmost value.</p>

<p>The figures and the facts recorded afforded startling
demonstration of the immensity of London, and of the
growing gravity and complexity of the great problems
of London life.</p>

<p>London was huge before—appalling almost in size and
population; now it was shown to be huger than ever.
Everything was on a more enormous scale. The masses
of population were far larger, and were rapidly increasing;
and with this increase everything concerning their existence
became more and more complicated, and every reform more
and more difficult. The removal of evils affecting their
physical and social being would be a heavier task, the
supervision of their conditions of life more onerous and
exacting, and the provision of a government to secure their
well-being a graver problem than ever.</p>

<p>One of the great forces unceasingly at work, and one
of the great contributory causes to insanitation and to the
maintenance of a high death-rate was, undoubtedly, drink.
It led to poverty and overcrowding, it led to ill-health and
greater susceptibility to disease; and the evils acted and
reacted upon each other indefinitely—a vicious circle from
which there was no escape, overcrowding leading to a
craving for drink, and drink resulting in poverty and therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
overcrowding with its attendant evils and high
mortality. Since the unfortunate moment in 1830 when
Parliament deemed it expedient “for the better supplying
the public with beer” to give greater facilities for the sale
thereof, and scattered broadcast throughout the nation the
seed of unlimited evil, facilities for drink not only of beer
but of spirits have been practically unlimited. Against this
source of evil, which is often mentioned in their reports,
neither Medical Officers of Health nor Vestries could contend,
and had no power to contend. But all through
the history of the sanitary evolution of London this deep
underlying curse was present, acting as a perpetual clog
upon sanitary and social progress—a horrible, all-pervading
and tremendous power for evil.</p>

<p>In the earlier years of this new decade of 1861–70 the
central government—the Metropolitan Board of Works—was
demonstrating the great utility of a central governing
authority for London, and a task was nearing accomplishment
which was absolutely the first essential, the very
foundation of an improved state of the public health.</p>

<p>It was engaged in pressing vigorously forward the great
system for the sewerage and drainage of London designed
for taking off the sewage and refuse waters of a prospective
population of three and a half million persons, and the
rainfall of a drainage area of 117 square miles. Until
those works were completed no great degree of sanitary
improvement could be expected.</p>

<p>In 1861 the Board reported that a portion thereof had
been finished, and as the work gradually progressed the
Vestries were able to avail themselves of the deeper outfalls
afforded, and to undertake drainage works in their several
areas.</p>

<p>By 1865 the great task was virtually accomplished.
Eighty-two miles of main intercepting sewers had been
constructed, and the sewage was being conveyed away
by them several miles distant from London.</p>

<p>Their completion enabled the Metropolitan Board to fill
in the open sewers, which had so long polluted the atmosphere,
and been such a fertile source of disease in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
districts where they existed, and took away from the
Vestries any excuse for delay in carrying out the construction
and putting in order of the local sewers for
which they were responsible.</p>

<p>The central authority had thus brought into existence
a gigantic system of sewerage by which the river near
London ceased to be the main sewer of London, and the
whole of the metropolis was relieved of many of the most
powerful causes of fever, cholera, and other destructive
diseases. It was a great work, admirably and expeditiously
carried out, and it cleared the way for other sanitary
reforms which were impossible without an effective general
system of sewerage, yet which were essential if a satisfactory
condition of the public health were ever to be
attained.</p>

<p>The central body also proved its great utility by securing
uniformity in the sewerage and drainage works which fell
to the duty of the local authorities to carry out. All plans
by the Vestries had to be submitted to the Board so that
the Board might see that they were consistent with the
main system.</p>

<p>Both main drainage and house drainage were thus steadily
being extended and improved, but in many places things
were still outrageously bad. Nor had the creation of fresh
evils been effectually prevented, for from Bromley came
the complaint that several new estates were rapidly being
covered with small house property which drained into
cesspools.</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Fulham wrote
<span class="no-break">(1866):—</span></p>

<p>“The active operations of your Board have fortunately
relieved the Fulham district to a large extent from that
pregnant source of mischief—want of drainage; still there
are large tracts of building land yet unprovided for, on
much of which houses by dozens are being squatted without
any regard to this great essential by the builders, save the
horrid cesspool system. It is enough to have to counteract
the evils of past imprudence without perpetuating them by
such wilful recklessness….”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>The supply of water to the inhabitants of London was of
equal importance to an efficient system of sewerage. The
problem had by no means been solved by “The Metropolis
Water Act” of 1852, which had enacted that within five
years after the passing of the Act a constant supply should
be given by the companies. Unfortunately, the supply was
in the hands of various public companies over which the
local governing authorities had practically little or no
control, and, like all sanitary legislation of this period,
the results were not commensurate with the intentions
of the Legislature.</p>

<p>An illustration of how insufficient the supply was, was
detailed in a report of the Medical Officer of Health for
Whitechapel in <span class="no-break">1862:—</span></p>

<p>“A return has been made by the Inspector of 133 courts
in the district.</p>

<p>“Of these—in 48 which contain 388 houses and have
a population of 3,233 persons the water supply is by stand
taps only, from which the water flows daily (Sundays
excepted) for a period varying from quarter to half an
hour.</p>

<p>“This intermittent supply is totally inadequate to the
wants of the people.”</p>

<p>Parliament made an effort in 1862<a id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> to amend the law,
and enacted that where a house was without a proper
supply of water the owner or occupier might be required
by the Vestry to obtain such supply, and if such notice was
not complied with, the Vestry might do the necessary work
and recover the expenses from the owner, and then require
the water companies to supply the water.</p>

<p>But the Act was of little practical value, and was made of
less value by the inaction of the local authorities.</p>

<p>A few extracts from reports of Medical Officers of Health
show how thoroughly unsatisfactory and disastrous to
the health of the people the existing condition of affairs
was.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Fulham wrote in
1864<span class="no-break">:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“The powers at present given by Statutes for enforcing
a supply of water for domestic use are, within the Fulham
district, all but inoperative. The cry amongst the cottagers
is still for water—water without which all other sanitary
appliances are at best abortive, without which in ample and
continuous flow no community can be preserved in healthfulness.
On this essential will depend the perfect working
of our deep and costly sewers, on this alone will hang
success in minor drainage matters. Water, that first and
most important element of health and cleanliness, exists
in name alone in masses of our cottage property here, and
consequently neither purity of person nor of dwelling can
be ensured.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Martin-in-the-Fields
wrote in 1864 deploring that the new laws of the water
companies did not provide for water being supplied on
Sunday. “It is to be lamented that people should at
any time have to go about begging water, and more
especially so on Sundays, the very day they most require
it.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Westminster wrote
<span class="no-break">(1864):—</span></p>

<p>“The water supply to many of the courts and alleys is
very unsatisfactory. No Sunday supply.</p>

<p>“It does seem a monstrous arrangement that for 52
days in the year the public should be deprived of that
which they pay for, but have no means of substituting by
anything else.”</p>

<p>And to complete the hardships which the people suffered
under in the matter of water supply, if the house-owner did
not pay the water rates when called upon to do so, the
water company might cut off the supply of the people in
the house. This was frequently done, and the Medical
Officer of Health for Whitechapel recorded how for four
<span class="no-break">months—</span></p>

<p>“The inhabitants of Tuson’s Court, Spitalfields, had been
entirely deprived of water in consequence of the water
company refusing to continue any longer the supply, as
the landlord had not paid the water rate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The quality of the water, though improved by the change
of intakes to the part of the Thames above Teddington
Lock, left very much to be desired. It was no longer
contaminated by the entire sewage of the metropolis,
but it was still by sewage poured into the river and
its tributaries by towns higher up—Oxford, Reading,
Windsor, Chertsey, Hampton, and others—and received,
unchecked, the whole of the pollution, solid and fluid, of
the district constituting the watershed. And this same
water, after it had been so polluted, was abstracted from
the river, sand-filtered, and pumped into the metropolis
for domestic uses and distributed to the consumers.<a id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The housing of the people was the problem which, above
all others, was more and more forcing itself upon the attention
of those whose work brought them into actual contact
with the conditions of life of the great mass of the people
who were in their charge; not merely the construction of
the houses or their situation, but the accommodation
afforded and the conditions of life therein.</p>

<p>“Our forefathers,” wrote one of the Medical Officers of
Health, “knew nothing about the public health, and cared
less. They added house to house, and street to street,
according to their own will and apparent benefit, and so
have left us this mingled heritage.”</p>

<p>And there were streets and courts and alleys which were
not fit for human habitation, and which could never be
made so; and thousands upon thousands of houses where
“nothing short of a hurricane would suffice to displace and
renew the air.”</p>

<p>London had enough to suffer under from the state of the
existing houses, and an appalling task before her to remedy
them, but not alone was this enormous evil practically
unattacked, but fresh sources of evil were allowed to be
created, and new houses were being erected which would
carry into the future the evils which efforts were now being
made to put an end to.</p>

<p>“A house may be built anywhere,” wrote one of the
Medical Officers of Health in 1862, “and almost anyhow,
provided all the rooms can be lighted and ventilated from
a street or alley adjoining. The object of the builder is to
save as much ground, materials, and expense as possible.
The result is not difficult to foresee….”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>No regard, moreover, was had to the ground on which
new houses were being built, though that was all-important
for a healthy dwelling.</p>

<p>“… Some of the new houses are built upon garden
mould or old ‘slop shoots,’” wrote the Medical Officer of
Health for Paddington in 1870–1; “these thin and flimsy
shells of lath and plaster truly merit the term ‘slop
buildings.’ A dangerous moisture and miasma arises
from houses built upon such an unhealthy foundation.”</p>

<p>How disastrous the results were to the inhabitants is
pointed out by several Medical Officers of Health.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Mile-End-Old-Town
wrote <span class="no-break">(1866):—</span></p>

<p>“… Many open places now built upon, or being built
upon, have been for years the receptacles for all kinds of
animal and vegetable refuse, and have become thoroughly
impregnated with the products of their decomposition….
The result to the health of the occupants is daily realised
by the excessive number of zymotic diseases and deaths
which occur in them.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Limehouse <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Ask about the general health and the houses. ‘Never
been well since coming in, and the children always ailing;
and my husband says he feels more refreshed when he
comes from his work than after he gets up in the morning.
And then everything spoils; meat put into a cupboard is
musty in a night. One can keep nothing.’</p>

<p>“These are all new houses.”</p>

<p>And a few years later, referring to this same subject, he
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“A half mile off, a few years ago, there were some acres
of gravel pits. The gravel had gone for road-making, &amp;c.
The large pit was then filled up on invitation of the owner,
with the aid of the scavenger and others, with all the slush
and filth of a large circle of contributors. When this fund
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of abominations became consolidated, it was built over in
the usual style. They were soon occupied by tenants and
lodgers. Now this site during the epidemic (of cholera)
has been a great slaughter field—the mortality was
shocking.”</p>

<p>And he added, “there are thousands of such houses built
about London.”</p>

<p>The Building Act of 1855 was very far from being an
effective prevention of such devices as these. It required a
notice to be given to the Vestry before any new building was
commenced, and a plan to be submitted for approval showing
the proposed drainage and the levels of the building;
but this requirement appears to have been by no means
universally complied with, and some local authorities had
great difficulty in getting notices of new buildings commenced
within the district. And its restrictions were not
sufficient to prevent the speculative builder in places from
raising his block of houses in the fields with neither road or
sewer for their accommodation, and with the frequent result
of fever-stricken tenants.</p>

<p>With the increasing knowledge of their districts gained
by the numerous Medical Officers of Health distributed
over the whole metropolis, the widespread prevalence of
overcrowding in London, and the virulent evils, physical,
social, and moral, consequent thereon, come into greater
prominence and more vivid light than ever before.</p>

<p>Throughout the central parts of London the process of
demolition of houses of all sorts and sizes, inhabited by the
well-to-do or by the poorest, was continuing. The street
improvements which were being carried out in some places
entailed extensive demolitions; whilst the construction of
railways and the erection of large stations necessitated the
destruction of hundreds of others, mostly those inhabited
by poorer persons. Thus, in the improvements in the
Holborn Valley, 348 houses, accommodating 1,044 families
and 4,176 persons, were taken down and not replaced. And
in St. Pancras, and many other districts, the dwellings of
the poor were constantly being removed by railway expansion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>The subject of the displacement of labourers in consequence
of great public works in the metropolis was brought
before the House of Lords in 1861 by Lord Derby.<a id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>“It affects,” he said, “in the most vital manner the
interests of a large portion of the population who are utterly
unable to protect themselves against legislation, however
unfavourably it may bear upon them.</p>

<p>“In the metropolis and its suburbs sixty to seventy miles
of new line (railway) are proposed—a great portion of these
passing through the most crowded streets.”</p>

<p>He described specially the parish of St. Bartholomew’s,
in Cripplegate, with a population of about 5,000 inhabiting
500 houses.</p>

<p>“Throughout it, there are not ten families who occupy a
house to themselves, although the bulk of the houses contain
only three rooms. The incumbent tells me the aristocracy
of his parish consists of families who are able to indulge in
the luxury of two rooms. But the greater number have
one room, and one only, and this is sometimes divided
between more than one family.</p>

<p>“Half of these houses are under notice for the railway.”</p>

<p>And Lord Shaftesbury described a great demolition of
houses which took place a few years previously in the
neighbourhood of Field Lane, City: “1,000 houses
were pulled down; 4,000 families, comprising 12,000 individuals,
were turned out and driven into the surrounding
tenements.”</p>

<p>Lord Granville suggested, as a remedy, the provision of
cheap trains to carry artizans from healthy dwellings in the
suburbs to the scene of their work, and Lord Redesdale
said he had introduced clauses into the Railway Bill providing
that the companies should run a cheap train every
day. But, as Lord Shaftesbury pointed out,<a id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> that would
not be sufficient, <span class="no-break">as—</span></p>

<p>“In some cases the men are under an engagement to
their employers not to live more than a certain distance from
the warehouse,” in order that no time might be lost in
executing orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The remedy, moreover, could only be very gradual in its
operation, and was quite inadequate to meet the existing
emergency.</p>

<p>This demolition of houses had thus the two-fold result of
at once intensifying overcrowding in the remaining houses
in the localities affected, and in extending the area of overcrowding
by causing a migration to other localities, many of
which were themselves rapidly becoming overcrowded. And
this, combined with the natural growth of the population
and the constant stream of immigration into London,
resulted in overcrowding on a far larger scale than had
hitherto prevailed.</p>

<p>In Mile-End-Old-Town the West Ward had received in
the decade 1851–61 an addition of 3,094 persons, whilst
but 84 new houses had been built—the South Ward 1,372
persons and 71 new houses built.</p>

<p>In Shoreditch, in 1863, “The tendency to overcrowding
was increasing year by year.</p>

<p>“Being mostly operatives, &amp;c. … accustomed to live
near their places of employment, they were naturally unwilling
to travel further than necessary, and so have accepted
the readiest accommodation for their families.”</p>

<p>Of Whitechapel, the Medical Officer of Health wrote in
<span class="no-break">1865:—</span></p>

<p>“The evil of overcrowding is annually increasing, and if
means be not adopted to check it, the overcrowding will
soon become of an alarming extent….</p>

<p>“Houses formerly occupied by single families are let out in
separate tenements, and every room now contains a distinct
family; and to such an extent is this separate letting of
rooms carried out, that from information given me there is
not a single street in the parish of Whitechapel that is not
more or less a nursery of pauperism in consequence of this
sub-division of tenements.”</p>

<p>Away in the west, in Fulham, there had been a “flood of
immigrants,” chiefly of “the lower and labouring classes.”
The population had increased 30 per cent., and the Medical
Officer of Health wrote <span class="no-break">(1865):—</span></p>

<p>“In watching the enormous accession of population to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the Fulham district, one cannot otherwise than observe the
constant tendency to overcrowding amongst the labouring
people, whilst there seems every possibility of this human
tide increasing. The tremendous demolition of the houses
hitherto occupied by the working classes more immediately
in London itself has dislodged thousands of families,
whilst no systematised provision has been made for their
reception.”</p>

<p>In Westminster the Medical Officer of Health wrote in
<span class="no-break">1865:—</span></p>

<p>“The dwellings of the poor were never in a worse or
more unsatisfactory state than they are at present from the
large number of houses that have been already demolished.
The poor are now driven into the most wretched apartments,
and which, in consequence of the increased demand, can
only be obtained at the most extravagant rates. They are
consequently compelled to herd together in one room, usually
barely sufficient for half of those it is now made to hold.”</p>

<p>The south side of the river was much in the same plight
as the north; but there, there was more room for expansion.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Saviour, Southwark,
wrote in <span class="no-break">1865:—</span></p>

<p>“The numerous improvements which continue to be
made in and about the heart of London have so increased
the value of house property that overcrowding has been
almost inevitable.</p>

<p>“… In a vast number of instances families numbering
four to seven persons, ill or well, live, cook, wash, and sleep
in rooms the dimensions of which are not greater than is
now demanded for each sick person in the workhouse.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. George-the-Martyr,
Southwark, <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“In many of the districts of the metropolis between 60
and 70 per cent. of the population are compelled to live in
one small overcrowded room, and in which every domestic
operation has to be carried on; in it birth and death takes
place; there plays the infant, there lies the corpse; it is lived
in by day, and slept in by night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>In the necessity for house accommodation all sorts of
places were being pressed into use, and people driven into
“places that are themselves unfit for habitation, not having
the elements of life and health about them.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Paddington described,
in 1867, how mews had been thus <span class="no-break">utilised:—</span></p>

<p>“In fact these back streets, originally built and intended
for horses and vehicles, and only those persons without
encumbrances who are engaged attending to them, have
now become the resort of persons with large families following
all kinds of business—rag, bone, and bottle stores, shops
of various kinds, including beer-houses, builders, carpenters,
smiths, tailors, sweeps, find accommodation here. Inhabiting
the rooms above, too small, and unfitted with proper
domestic accommodation for a family, live a vast population
of all ages. These evils, rather than otherwise, are
increasing.”</p>

<p>Into such houses and such rooms the people were by
stress of circumstances compelled to go, and, as the Medical
Officer of Health for St. Giles’ pointed out <span class="no-break">(1863):—</span></p>

<p>“A larger rent can be obtained for the same room if it is
overcrowded by a large family than if it be hired for only as
many inmates as it can properly receive. Hence the interests
of landlords are constantly on the one side, the health of the
poor on the other….”</p>

<p>What this pressure upon accommodation produced may
be gathered from a few figures given by the Medical Officer
of Health for <span class="no-break">Whitechapel:—</span></p>

<p class="p1">“In one room in Swan Court, having one window, seven
persons slept—a man and his wife, the daughter aged 24 in
consumption lying in bed, and four younger children; the
cubic contents of the room were 910 = 130 cubic feet to each
person.</p>

<p>“In Bell Court four persons occupied a room with 94
cubic feet each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“In three rooms in Hayes Court, each 10 × 8 × 8 feet;
each with only one window opening into a narrow court;
each occupied by eight persons = 80 cubic feet to each
person.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Pancras (1865)
described some of the consequences of the conversion of a
house, built originally for one family, into one inhabited by
several <span class="no-break">families:—</span></p>

<p>“… At present these families occupy usually a single
room only in a house of six or eight rooms adapted for only
one family. The water supply is inadequate, and at some
distance from the upper rooms, and there is but one closet,
one dust bin, one coal cellar, and one wash house for the
whole. No one is responsible for the cleanly condition of
the closet, the water tank, the single staircase, the basement,
the areas, and the yard, or for emptying the dust
bin.”</p>

<p>One of the worst forms of overcrowding was when it
resulted in what was described as “indecent occupation.”
For instance, as reported (1861) by the Medical Officer of
Health for <span class="no-break">Whitechapel:—</span></p>

<p>“In a room in Windmill Court there slept the mother,
two adult daughters, and two adult sons.</p>

<p>“In another room in the same court, a man and his wife,
the daughter aged 16, and three adult sons.”</p>

<p>In 68 instances the rooms were “indecently occupied,”
that is to say, adult brothers and sisters, or a father and
daughter slept in the same room.</p>

<p>And he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“We may well inquire how such gross indecency and
want of self-respect can exist in this country, which is
usually considered to be the centre of civilisation, and where
so much money is spent in imparting religious and moral
instruction to the people—yet such is the state in which
many of the inhabitants of this district live, as is ascertained
on a house-to-house visitation.”</p>

<p>And in the following year he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“On visiting the houses in low neighbourhoods it is by no
means of unfrequent occurrence to find an adult brother and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
sister, a father and adult daughter, a mother and adult son,
occupying the same bed. What good citizenship can be
expected to be manifested by a class in whom the moral
feeling is so low?”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. James’, in his report
(1862), <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“This close association of several families in one house
is productive of immense evil; it prevents proper parental
control; it encourages an association of the sexes which
leads directly to one of our greatest social evils; and is one
of the most fruitful causes of the spread and fatality of
zymotic diseases of childhood, and lays the foundation of
the scrofula and consumption which every year carry off a
fifth of all who die amongst us….</p>

<p>“It is almost impossible, amidst the filth and stench of
dirty houses and imperfect drains, that the working man’s
family should be able to develop those moral and intellectual
qualities which are, after all, more worth to the community
than any saving of rates.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Martin-in-the-Fields,
wrote <span class="no-break">(1865):—</span></p>

<p>“Rents have become so heavy that few labouring men can
afford more than one room. Overcrowding in such rooms
must increase, and with it the fearful results of men, women,
girls, and boys, all sleeping in the same apartment. Neither
religion nor morality can increase under the existing circumstances
of our poorer classes. It is almost returning to
the habits of our barbarous ancestors or the untutored
savages of Africa and Australia.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Holborn <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Depend upon it, the moral and physical training of the
people is more influenced by lessons—whether in health and
cleanliness, or in religion and morality—that they are constantly
receiving at their own firesides than by any extraneous
teachings.</p>

<p>“When a child has been allowed to grow up with a
diseased body, and a polluted mind, in a wretched room,
without light, without cleanliness, and without any notions
of decency, our curative efforts, whether medical, missionary,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
or reformatory, are as mere patchwork compared with the
great preventive precaution of keeping his home as pure, as
decent, and as wholesome, as possible.”</p>

<p>No more powerful description can be given of the moral
evils of overcrowding than that of Dr. J. Simon in
<span class="no-break">1865:—</span></p>

<p>“Where ‘overcrowding’ exists in its sanitary sense,
almost always it exists even more perniciously in certain
moral senses. In its higher degrees it almost necessarily
involves such negation of all delicacy, such unclean confusion
of bodies and bodily functions, such mutual exposure of
animal and sexual nakedness, as is rather bestial than
human.</p>

<p>“To be subject to these influences is a degradation which
must become deeper and deeper for those on whom it continues
to work. To children who are born under its curse,
it must often be a very baptism into infamy.”<a id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Overcrowding was not confined to tenement-house rooms
alone. The great bulk of the working classes left their
overcrowded abodes to do their day’s work in overcrowded
factories, workshops, and workplaces; and in very many
such places men, women, and even children were crammed
together in rooms where healthy existence was impossible.</p>

<p>A great deal of information on this great branch of the
sanitary condition of the inhabitants of London is given in
the Reports from the Commissioners on Children’s Employment,
and in the very valuable reports of special inquiries
instituted by the Medical Department of the Privy Council.</p>

<p>One of these inquiries related to Bakehouses, of which
there were about 3,000 in the metropolis in 1862.<a id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>As a rule the place in which the bread of London was
made was what in houses in general was the coal-hole and
the front kitchen.</p>

<p>Very many bakehouses in London were stated to be in a
shockingly filthy state, arising from imperfect sewerage and
bad ventilation and neglect, and the bread must, during
the process of fermentation, get impregnated with the
noxious gases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The sleeping places were of the worst description,<a id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> some
of the men sleeping in the bakehouse itself. Many bakehouses
were infested with rats, beetles, cockroaches, and
noxious smells. The smells from the drains were very
offensive—the air of the small bakehouses was generally
overloaded with foul gases from the drains, from the ovens,
and from the fermentations of the bread, and with the
emanations from the men’s bodies; the air thus contaminated
was necessarily incorporated with the dough in the
process of kneading.</p>

<p>Half of the bakehouses in London would, it was stated,
require the application to them of the Nuisances Removal Act.</p>

<p>Another inquiry related to the tailoring trade in the
metropolis.<a id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The places in which work was done were
reported as varying much in their sanitary conditions,
but almost universally were overcrowded and ill-ventilated,
and in a high degree unfavourable to health. Some
were underground, either in the basement of a house, or
built like a large kennel in a small enclosed yard, and
were such that no domestic servant would inhabit. In
exceedingly few shops had there been any attempts at
ventilation. The ventilation through the windows was
practically inefficient, and instances were given of what
had been found in sixteen of the most important West-end
shops. In one an average of 156 cubic feet space was
allowed to each operative, in another 150 cubic feet, in
another 112 cubic feet. Deficient ventilation, heat, and
draughts, were the causes of diseases.</p>

<p>A paper read by Dr. E. Symes Thompson (Assistant
Physician to King’s College Hospital) at the Social Science
Association Meeting in London, 1862, described the condition
under which printers did their work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Printers often work sixteen to eighteen hours a day
in a confined and heated atmosphere; perhaps thirty men
and as many gaslights in a low room without ventilation
or chimney, where air only enters when the door is
opened….</p>

<p>“Printing is only one of the many trades which entail the
sacrifice of every hygienic necessity, and the cause of the
unhealthy looks of the workpeople cannot fail to strike any
observant person who may visit their workshops. The
rooms are mostly low, the windows fixed, and there is often
no chimney or other ventilation.</p>

<p>“This is the case in large and small factories as well as in
workshops—in the workroom of the milliner, the sempstress,
or the bookbinder.</p>

<p>“In many occupations, besides the evils alluded to, the
air is charged with foreign matters, which are drawn into
the lungs at each inspiration; <em>e.g.</em>, the sorting and tearing
up of dirty rags in paper manufactories. The dust and fluff
arising in flax, woollen, and cotton factories, and in furworks,
produce similar results—and brass finishers.”</p>

<p>And in another paper at the same meeting Mr. George
Godwin detailed his experiences as regarded the conditions
under which milliners, dressmakers, and other needlewomen
worked.</p>

<p>“In an upper room in Oxford Street, not 10 feet square,
I have seen a dozen delicate young women closely shut up
making artificial flowers; and there when business is
pressing they work from 8 in the morning till 12 o’clock
at night.</p>

<p>“Many of the workrooms of fashionable milliners are
similarly overcrowded, as are those where young girls are
engaged in book-stitching.”</p>

<p>He gave as an example a house in Fleet Street.</p>

<p>“The staircase is confined and without ventilation—the
atmosphere is steaming and smells of glue.</p>

<p>“In the first room looked into, 40 young women and girls
were sorting and stitching books. There was a stove but
no ventilation…. There were more than 200 persons in
that house, pent up without provision of the first necessity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of life—pure air. Poor creatures so placed are being slowly
slain.</p>

<p>“Other trades, such as cap and bonnet makers, trimmers,
blond-joiners, &amp;c., to which I have looked with some little
care, are forced in many places to do just the same thing.”</p>

<p>“The extent of suffering entailed, and the loss to the
community, it would be difficult to calculate. It is time
that legislation should be tried to secure wholesome workplaces
for the people. Interference is needed for thousands
of persons—especially young females—the debilitated
mothers <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in posse</i>, should they live, of our future population.
In our infant schools, too, where incalculable mischief is
done by overcrowding, it is greatly required. The evil is
sapping the strength of the land.”</p>

<p>“In several parts of London persons employed in making
cheap clothing are boxed up in crowds, … some striving
to get a living in a death-giving atmosphere.</p>

<p>“Shoemakers are often as ill-placed. In wretched apartments,
in an ill-drained house, may be found men and boys
huddled together without room to breathe.”</p>

<p>It was under such pitiable conditions that large masses of
the working classes of London had to earn their daily
bread.</p>

<p>Lord Shaftesbury truly said that “the sanitary condition
of these people was of national importance, not only on
account of the waste of life, but the waste of health which
every year threw thousands and tens of thousands upon
the rates.”<a id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>And large numbers of children were also employed under
insanitary conditions, and were made to do heavy work for
long hours, and the consequences to their health were
disastrous.<a id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> That their constitutions should be undermined
and their physical development should be most seriously
deteriorated was a necessary result.</p>

<p>There was a chorus from the Medical Officers of Health as
to the evil sanitary consequences of overcrowding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Overcrowded dwellings are among the most prolific
sources of disease, immorality, and pauperism.”<a id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>“Overcrowding—one of the elements by which disease is
not only generated but sustained.”<a id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>“Overcrowding is a constant source of fever.”</p>

<p>“The great difficulty of obtaining lodgment for the working
classes has caused overcrowding of the poor in an unprecedented
manner, and consequently the development of
typhus which is considered to be bred in the pestilential
atmosphere of overcrowded dwellings.”<a id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Overcrowding led to numerous, indeed to all sorts and
kinds of diseases.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Pancras <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“It has been shown that consumption and the so-called
tubercular diseases are developed by want of pure air more
than by any other cause.”</p>

<p>And not alone did the overcrowding lead to disease,
but it rendered it difficult if not impossible to check
disease.</p>

<p>“How is it possible,” wrote one of them, “to prevent
the spread and fatality of fever and whooping-cough
when six or seven persons are shut up in one small room
breathing the same air loaded with zymotic poison over and
over again?</p>

<p>“The danger of allowing a deadly atmosphere to be
engendered by the crowding together of persons in a small
room without sufficient ventilation is unfortunately not
confined to the inmates of that particular room, but those
diseases which are therein generated extend far beyond its
immediate vicinity, and under some circumstances a large
portion of a district will suffer in consequence.”<a id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Rendle, previously Medical Officer of Health for St.
George-the-Martyr, in his evidence<a id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> before a Select Committee
in 1866, <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“… The overcrowding exists to such an extent that
the poor cannot by any possibility do other than breed
disease, and when they breed it they give it to others.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Shaftesbury <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“As to the effects of all this overcrowding, can anything
be more prejudicial to the human system than the filthy
squalor, the fœtid air, and depressing influences of these
dwellings?</p>

<p>“When you ask why so many of the working men betake
themselves to the ale-house or gin-palace, the answer lies in
the detestable state of their homes.</p>

<p>“I have had it from hundreds of both women and men
that this cause, and this cause alone, has driven them to the
use of ardent spirits…. Nine-tenths of our poverty,
misery, and crime, are produced by habits of intoxication,
and I trace those habits, not altogether, but mainly, to the
pestilential and ruinous domiciliary condition of the great
mass of the population of this metropolis and the large towns
of the country.”<a id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>“No bodily labour induces an exhaustion of the vital
powers comparable to that resulting from the habitual
breathing of air contaminated by the overcrowding of
human beings.”<a id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>For children born under such circumstances of overcrowding
and filth, and in such insanitary surroundings,
birth was mostly followed by an early death.</p>

<p>“Infancy in London has to creep into life in the midst of
foes,” as the <cite>Times</cite> truly remarked in 1861.</p>

<p>Among the greatest of these foes was overcrowding. The
statistics of infantile mortality are fairly reliable, and, so far
as there are errors, those errors were in understating and not
overstating it.</p>

<p>In St. Giles’, in 1861, 43½ per cent. of the total number of
deaths were of children under five years of age.</p>

<p>“This enormous infantile mortality,” wrote the Medical
Officer of Health, “is unfortunately only what is customary
in our district.”</p>

<p>In the Strand, 1861, the percentage of deaths under five
annually exceeded 45 per cent. of the total deaths. In
Westminster, in 1861, there were 1,685 deaths, 770 being
those of children under five—of which in St. John’s parish,
out of 834 deaths, 427 were under five—or over 50 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>In Bethnal Green in 1862 it was close upon 60 per cent.</p>

<p>In the Potteries, Notting Dale, with a population of 1,100,
the deaths of children in 1870 under five were 63 per cent.
of all deaths. In 1871, 72 per cent.</p>

<p>On the south side of the river the same tale was told. In
Wandsworth 42 per cent. in 1861; in Battersea 45 per cent.
in 1862; in Rotherhithe, in 1862, nearly 50 per cent.; in
Bermondsey, in 1863, 57 per cent.</p>

<p>“It certainly,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for
Fulham, “could not have been intended by Providence that
of all the children born, nearly one-half should die without
attaining one-fourteenth part of the threescore years and ten
allotted to mankind—and yet we see the yearly realisation
of this astounding fact.”</p>

<p>Other causes besides overcrowding contributed to this
great mortality.</p>

<p>“Poverty,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health of Poplar,
“with its concomitants—defective nourishment, want of
cleanliness and ventilation, malaria, overcrowded dwellings,
deficient supply or impure quality of water—these all act
with unerring force upon the tender constitutions of the
young.”</p>

<p>And another <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“What with overcrowding, insufficient food, and inattention
to cleanliness, it is almost impossible an infant can resist
an attack of the commonest disorder.”</p>

<p>And some places were in such evil sanitary condition
that child life was impossible therein. Of two Courts
in Islington the Medical Officer of Health reported in
<span class="no-break">1863:—</span></p>

<p>“Young children cannot live there. All that are born
there, or are brought to reside there, are doomed to die within
two years.”</p>

<p>The state of the public health generally as the result of
all these sanitary abominations was very unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1863 the mortality of London was unusually high.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Giles’ <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The year has been conspicuous for a high mortality
resulting from the prevalence of epidemics to an unusual
degree—smallpox, scarlatina, typhus.”</p>

<p>The following year he reported to have <span class="no-break">been—</span></p>

<p>“A year of exceptional mortality…. Death rate 29·74
per thousand, or, if the deaths of parishioners in hospitals
be included, 31·10…. Tubercular diseases, of which
consumption affecting the lungs is the most important,
were as usual intensely fatal in our district.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel drew
attention to the increase of mortality in his district. He
was evidently puzzled and perplexed by it, and “candidly
confessed” his inability to account for it.</p>

<p>“I may, however, venture a few conjectures.” Among
them was this very suggestive one—“that a change has
taken place in the constitution of the people so that they
are now less able to bear the effects of disease than
formerly.”</p>

<p>Suggestions and recommendations for ameliorating this
appalling condition of things poured in upon many of the
local authorities from their Medical Officers of Health.</p>

<p>Upon several points there was an absolute consensus
of opinion.</p>

<p>One of these was that all houses let out in separate
tenements and inhabited by many families should be
registered by the local authorities—that rules and regulations
should be made for their management, and that
constant inspection by the sanitary authority was an
absolute necessity if the proper conditions of health were
to be maintained.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Bethnal Green
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“All sanitary evils fall with greatest force upon those
who are unable to quit the scene of their misery or to
provide the means for its alleviation.</p>

<p>“Nothing but adaptation of the present houses to the
necessities of healthy existence and the demolition of those
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
houses that are unfit for human habitation can contribute
so much to life and strength.”</p>

<p>A Committee of the District Board in Poplar wrote
<span class="no-break">(1866):—</span></p>

<p>“It would be a satisfactory alteration of the law if no
houses were allowed to be tenanted unless a certificate that
these premises were fit for habitation were first obtained
from the District Board of Works.”</p>

<p>And the necessity of constant inspection was even more
vigorously expressed.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Hackney wrote
<span class="no-break">(1861):—</span></p>

<p>“The experience of the past year again shows the
necessity of keeping up a regular and efficient supervision
of the interior of houses….</p>

<p>“It is only by repeated and careful inspection of the
dwellings of the poor, and an inculcation at these visits
of the necessity for keeping clean their rooms that epidemic
diseases can be kept in check.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. James’ wrote
<span class="no-break">(1862):—</span></p>

<p>“The nuisances which are removed, are constantly
recurring. It is only by constant inspection and by
supervision repeated systematically from day to day, and
week to week, that those nuisances can be kept down which
are ever ready to destroy the life, and at one and the same
time sap the health and undermine the morality of the
community.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“If it were not for the vigilance of the Inspectors in
visiting the houses of the poor, nuisances would remain
altogether unattended to; for very few of the poor dare to
make a complaint from fear of being compelled to quit their
tenements.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officers of Health recognised that much of
the bad condition of the dwellings of the poorer classes
was due to the people themselves.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for Westminster
wrote <span class="no-break">(1865–6):—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is much to be regretted that in certain districts
of the parish only a temporary good is effected by a
sometimes lavish expenditure on the part of the proprietor.
The habits of the people are such that it is almost impossible
to do anything for their benefit. Not only are they
filthy in themselves, but they take every opportunity to
break, destroy, and steal anything that may be of value,
and what is even worse they appear to negative any
sanitary precaution effected for their benefit.”</p>

<p>But the broad truth was that the real, the primary
responsibility rested upon the “owners.”</p>

<p>Theirs was the property. And them it behoved to keep
that property in a condition which was not a danger to the
community and to the State.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel wrote
<span class="no-break">(1865):—</span></p>

<p>“The duty and interests of landlords appear to be at
variance as regards their doing to their houses what is
absolutely necessary for the well-being of their tenants. It
is unquestionably the duty of landlords to keep the houses
which they let out in separate tenements to the poor in
a healthy condition; but this is not always done even if
compulsory orders are signed and summonses issued….</p>

<p>“Many of the landlords of small house property fully
understand and carry out the rights of ownership, but fail
to carry out the duties which are enjoined upon them as
owners.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Islington, referring to
some vile property in his parish, wrote <span class="no-break">(1863):—</span></p>

<p>“Landlords of such property as this will rarely do
anything out of consideration for the health or lives of
their tenants; compulsion alone will extort amendments.
What is needed here is the closure of the fatal houses until
made fit for human habitation.”</p>

<p>How an “owner” could manage his property can be
gathered from the following report of the Medical Officer of
Health for Paddington (1863), which called attention to “the
insanitary condition of a block of houses (about thirty in
number) which had been for many years notoriously liable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to the invasion of epidemics and to the prevalence of those
diseases which are the known product of sanitary neglect—badly
constructed and dilapidated, and wanting in the
commonest appliances of cleanliness. All were the property
of one individual who had been repeatedly urged to put them
in a proper sanitary state.”</p>

<p>But it was not until stringent compulsory measures were
taken that he began to do so, and some years elapsed before
they were really done.</p>

<p>Here is another dreadful case of overcrowding and insanitation—this
time in St. Marylebone (1868).</p>

<p>Edwards <span class="no-break">Place:—</span></p>

<p>“Ten six-roomed houses occupied by 84 families, 277
persons, houses very dilapidated, many unfit for human
habitation. Orders for sanitary work are continually being
sent out by the Vestry to the owner of this wretched
property.</p>

<p>“A rental of £10 per annum would be an extravagant sum
to pay for either of these miserable dwellings, yet more than
three times that sum is expected from the destitute and
indigent people who inhabit them.”</p>

<p>Read by the light of the knowledge that insanitary
property meant disease, and disablement, and death to a very
high percentage of its occupiers, the proper compulsion to
have applied to “owners” such as these would have been
proceedings before a Coroner’s jury for culpable homicide if
not for actually deliberate murder.</p>

<p>The community has a right to be protected from the evil
results of the miserable housing of the poor.</p>

<p>Mr. George Godwin said in 1862, at the meeting of the
National Association for Promoting Social <span class="no-break">Science:—</span></p>

<p>“It should be no answer to the requirement of a certain
cubical space for each occupier, that the financial resources
of the parties will not admit of it.</p>

<p>“A man is not permitted to poison with prussic acid those
who are dependent on him because he is poor; neither
should he be allowed on that ground to kill them with bad
air and set up a fever-still for the benefit of his neighbours.”</p>

<p>Parliament, under the pressure of a slowly-developing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
public opinion, and in view of the ever accumulating
evidence and proof of the almost incredible insanitary condition
in which great masses of the people of London were
living, was beginning to show less reluctance to discuss and
deal with some of the multifarious matters affecting the
public health.</p>

<p>In 1860 it passed an Act which, however well intentioned,
was not of much effect. It was an effort to secure more
wholesome articles of food and drink for the public by
preventing their adulteration.</p>

<p>The past history of such legislation was rather interesting.<a id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
In 1731 an Act has been passed prescribing a penalty
for “sophisticating tea.”</p>

<p>“Several ill-disposed people frequently dyeing, fabricating,
very large quantities of sloe-leaves, &amp;c., in imitation of tea,
and colouring or staining and dyeing such leaves, and vending
the same as real tea to the prejudice of the health of His
Majesty’s subjects.”</p>

<p>“In year 1766–7 a further Act was passed inasmuch as
‘such evil practices were increased to a very great degree to
the injury and destruction of great quantities of timber,
wood, and underwoods.’</p>

<p>“Coffee had also been the subject of legislation, ‘burnt
scorched, or roasted peas, beans, &amp;c.,’ being used to
adulterate it.</p>

<p>“In 1816 an Act was passed against the adulteration of
beer and porter, and the use of molasses, liquorice, vitriol,
quassia, guinea pepper, or opium, and a lot of other ingredients
being prohibited.”</p>

<p>“In 1836 an Act was passed against the adulteration of
bread.”</p>

<p>And now in 1860 it was enacted that “every person who
shall sell as pure or unadulterated any article of food or drink
which is adulterated or not pure,” should on conviction be
fined.</p>

<p>The Vestries in the metropolis were empowered to
appoint analysts. The appointment was voluntary on the
part of the local authorities, and, if analysts were appointed,
their duties were confined to receiving and analysing
articles submitted to them by the purchasers, and certifying
the results. The purchasers had to pay the cost. No
officer was appointed to obtain samples or to enforce the
Act. And the Act is therefore worthy of note more as an
illustration of the inaction of the local authorities than for
any effect it had as regarded the prevention of adulteration.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1863 Parliament passed the “Bakehouse Regulation
Act,”<a id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> which enacted that every bakehouse should be kept
in a cleanly state, should be frequently lime-washed, and
should be properly provided with proper means for effectual
ventilation, and be free from effluvia arising from any drain,
privy, or other nuisance.</p>

<p>Also its use as a sleeping-place was prohibited, and the
onus of enforcing the provisions of the Act was imposed
upon the local sanitary authority.</p>

<p>And in 1863 it declared<a id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> that the law made in 1855 as to
the inspection and seizure of unwholesome food—meat,
poultry, flesh, fish, vegetables, fruit, &amp;c., &amp;c.—was defective,
and that other and more effectual provisions should be
substituted therefor; and others were accordingly substituted.</p>

<p>By an Act in 1864 the main principles contained in
previous Factory Acts were carried a stage further, in some
instances even to trades carried on in private houses.</p>

<p>“Every factory to which this Act applies shall be kept in
a cleanly state and be ventilated in such a manner, &amp;c., as to
render harmless dust, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately the main breakdown in the metropolis
in regard to nearly all the ameliorative sanitary legislation
of Parliament was directly caused by the very local authorities
who had been specially created for the purpose of
administering those laws. Primarily they were responsible
for the failure of very much of that legislation, and they
never seem to have at all realised, or been impressed by, the
gravity of their trust, or by the great responsibility to
their fellow-citizens which their position entailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Even in comparatively small matters their ingenuity in
counteracting the intentions of the Legislature was remarkable,
as can be seen from the following passage in a report
of one of the Medical Officers of <span class="no-break">Health:—</span></p>

<p>“I refer specially to the Sanitary Acts, to the Adulteration
of Food Act, and to the Metropolitan Gas Act, in each
of which cases the powers entrusted to them have not been
carried out.</p>

<p>“They appointed an examiner under the Adulteration
of Foods Act (1860), and also under the Metropolitan
Gas Act (1860), but the person appointed had no tools
given him with which to perform the work entrusted to
him.</p>

<p>“Both the Acts are dead letters in the parish. As to the
Metropolitan Gas Act, it conferred a large benefit, both as
to purity and cost, on the metropolis, but the Vestries failed
to carry out a single effective or important provision of that
Act.”</p>

<p>In 1860, also, an Act had been passed empowering the
local authorities in the metropolis to provide vehicles for
carrying persons suffering from infectious diseases to
hospital, and so obviating the danger to the public of such
persons being conveyed in cabs or other public vehicles.
That Act was also inoperative.</p>

<p>The Vestries and District Boards, however, did perform a
considerable amount of useful work. Local sewerage and
drainage works were on the whole effectively dealt with.
The rest of the work done was mostly of the routine order,
such as scavenging and paving and lighting, though even
that was not always done in the most sensible way, as
exemplified in Paddington (1866).</p>

<p>“The street sweepings of mud collected by the scavengers
are stored in enormous quantities in the middle of the parish
in a closely inhabited neighbourhood. Here it is allowed
to decompose, &amp;c. If it were intended to contrive an
arrangement for developing malaria in the midst of a
town population nothing could be better adapted for the
purpose.”</p>

<p>A few of them had soared to the height of widening a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
street, or acquiring some small open space; in most, if not
all, of these cases receiving financial help from the central
authority.</p>

<p>But as to the main causes of the prevailing insanitary
evils, their aversion to active measures was constantly in
evidence; equally so where the enforcement of the law
would have entailed cost on the owners of insanitary
houses.</p>

<p>In some matters the plea of defects in the legislation
might have been justifiably urged by them; in others they
were often much hampered by the dilatory procedure attending
proceedings for enforcing the sanitary provisions of the
Metropolitan London Management Act.</p>

<p>One of the Medical Officers of Health gives an <span class="no-break">illustration:—</span></p>

<p>“A very great nuisance was reported to us. We visited
it, but had to wait a fortnight before the Vestry met in order
to get leave to apply for a summons. The magistrate
requires a week before hearing the case, and then he gives
a week or two to do the work. So for a month or five
weeks the nuisance may remain.”</p>

<p>The result was that infectious disease was given a long
opportunity to spread itself unchecked through a whole
district; an opportunity which it freely availed itself of.</p>

<p>Complaints were also made by some of the Medical
Officers of Health that in attempts to enforce the law against
“overcrowding” the magistrate leant very much to the
landlord. This, too, might have acted as a discouragement
to them. What, however, is certain is, that the Vestries
and District Boards were not attempting to grapple with
the most crucial questions of all—the overcrowding, and
the housing.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Clerkenwell pointed
this out, so far as his parish was concerned <span class="no-break">(1861):—</span></p>

<p>“The principal sanitary improvements during the last five
years related almost exclusively to the drainage, whilst the
overcrowding and impure state of the dwellings of the poor
have been but little interfered with.”</p>

<p>The more serious blemish was pointed out by Dr. Hunter
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in his report of 1865 to the Medical Officer of the Privy
Council on the subject of overcrowding, and the removal of
persons from houses about to be <span class="no-break">destroyed:—</span></p>

<p>“There is no authority which can deal with London in
these matters as a whole, and they are matters in which
uniform treatment is quite necessary. The local authority
which finds the whole of its district overcrowded, naturally
hesitates before beginning action which may relieve one
house only to overfill the next, and may reasonably think
that such action, unless done thoroughly, not only through
the district, but through the whole capital, might prove
hurtful.”<a id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>And his opinion is weighty. But the local authorities
were very far from doing what they might have done to
abate many of the insanitary evils connected therewith.</p>

<p>Dr. William Rendell said<a id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a><span class="no-break">:—</span></p>

<p>“We have had till now but one Inspector of Nuisances—an
unwilling man….</p>

<p>“This is not a question of a defect in the law. These
bodies have the power of appointing Inspectors, but when
Inspectors are appointed it brings of course a large amount
of work in low property, and expense and trouble are
incurred. Therefore the easiest way to avoid it is not to
have Inspectors enough, so that the work may not be
found out.”</p>

<p>In fact, the fuller the information on the subject is, the
more clear it is that most of them did not want to move
in the matter.</p>

<p>The evidence of witnesses, not under Vestry control,
examined before the Select Committee on Metropolitan
Local Government in 1866, throws some light on this
point.</p>

<p>Mr. James Beale, himself a vestryman, <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“I have seen a great want both of intelligence and ability
among vestrymen.</p>

<p>“I should say you may divide Vestries into divisions—one-third,
as a rule, are of the right class of men who ought
to be returned, and two-thirds are not of the class who
ought to represent the intelligence or the property of the
districts from which they are sent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“The powers of Vestries are administered with too great
a regard to economy. Efficiency is always sacrificed to
economy. If an Act of Parliament requires them to do
certain things, it is as a rule avoided.”</p>

<p>He attributed the failure of the Vestries to the inferior
calibre of the persons composing them—“they agree to
resolutions, but do not carry them out. The ratepayers
take no interest in the elections in our parish. There is
a large number of the owners of small house property in the
Vestries who regard with great disfavour any increase of the
rates, however beneficial the increase might be to the general
health of the district.”</p>

<p>But some witnesses went further. Dr. William Rendell,
who had been Medical Officer of Health for St. George-the-Martyr,
<span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“I believe, the law being new to the Vestry, they did not
quite understand the mode of carrying it out; but it was
partly from corrupt motives, for on one occasion one of the
principal members of the Vestry, an owner of considerable
property in the parish, called me aside and requested me
to pass over certain property of his that I found in an
extremely bad condition. I did not pass it over, of course.
The chairman of the local committee was, as I thought,
appointed as a positive obstructer of sanitary measures; at
all events he acted as such. The obstructions arose from
an unwillingness to incur expense for fear of increasing the
rates, and from an interest that the members of the Vestry
had in keeping up the present state of things.”</p>

<p>Jobbery, and the exercise of influence to obstruct and
defeat the law, are hard to prove, especially after the lapse
of years, but one fact which stands out conspicuous, and
which is incontestable, shows how reprehensibly the great
majority of the Vestries and District Boards failed to
administer laws which in the interests of the public health,
and therefore of the public welfare, it was their duty to
administer. Deliberately, and in the light of knowledge,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
they would not make adequate arrangements even for the
sanitary inspection of their respective districts.</p>

<p>Thus, in Bethnal Green, in 1861, there was a population
of 105,000 persons, and 14,731 houses. The Vestry
appointed one single Inspector of Nuisances to cope with
the insanitary conditions of this city of houses, and of this
mass of people. Shoreditch, with a population of 129,364
persons, and 17,072 houses, also one Inspector. St. George’s,
Hanover Square, with 88,100 persons and 10,437 houses,
one Inspector; Paddington, Bermondsey, and several others,
all with large populations and thousands of houses, one
Inspector each.<a id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>A few had appointed two Inspectors: St. Marylebone
with 161,680 persons and 16,357 houses, and Islington with
155,341 persons and 20,704 houses.</p>

<p>Kensington, Lambeth, and Limehouse, had appointed
three Inspectors each. St. Pancras headed the list with
four, but its population was close upon 200,000 living in
close upon 22,000 houses.</p>

<p>How could it be expected that one Inspector could within
a year possibly inspect even one tithe of the places which
it was his duty to inspect apart altogether from other duties
he ought to perform? The Vestries and District Boards
had the facts constantly before their eyes (in the returns of
work made to them by the Medical Officer of Health)—the
numerous insanitary houses unfit for human habitation, the
overcrowding, the terrible amount of sickness and misery,
and they could calculate from the one man’s work, the
number of houses in the parish which were in a condition
dangerous to the health of their inmates, and to the public
health generally. The salary of an Inspector was so paltry
that they had no excuse on the ground of economy; and
the conclusion is inevitable that either they did not care what
the sanitary condition of the people was, or that “vested
interests in filth and dirt” were so powerful on those bodies
that filth and dirt must not be interfered with at the expense
of “owners” upon whom the cost of improvement must fall.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p>And a grimmer light is thrown upon these figures by the
following statement of the Medical Officer of Health for
Lambeth made in 1889, but referring to 1869.</p>

<p>“The Sanitary Inspector of twenty years ago (that is to
say of 1869) was an unskilled workman, holding that which
might almost be regarded as a sinecure office; an official
recruited into the services of the Vestry from the rank of
ex-sailors, ex-policemen, or army pensioners. A knowledge
upon sanitary matters acquired from a course of technical
training was not expected from him.”</p>

<p>The treatment meted out to some of the Medical Officers
of Health also showed the hostility of the Vestries to action.
Numerous are the passages in their reports complaining of
their recommendations being ignored. These officers were
miserably paid, allowing even for their being able to take
private practice. The Medical Officer of Health for
Lambeth was stated to have been the worst paid—receiving
only £200 a year for the performance of duties attaching to
an area of 4,000 acres with 23,000 inhabited houses upon it,
inhabited by 162,000 persons.</p>

<p>Dr. W. Farr (of the Registrar General’s Office) <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“I believe that in certain districts in London the Medical
Officer of Health is under all sorts of restraints. If he is
active, they look upon him with disfavour, and he is in
great danger of dismissal.”<a id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The Vestry of St. James’, Westminster (1866), checked
the zeal of their Medical Officer, Dr. Lankester, whose
salary was £200 a year, by reducing it to £150 after a
year or two when they found he was very earnest in his
work.</p>

<p>Dr. Rendell, the Medical Officer of Health for St. George-the-Martyr,
Southwark, resigned “in disgust that he was
not allowed to carry out the duties of his office.”</p>

<p>Once more the approach of Asiatic cholera—the nemesis
of insanitation, and of “fainéant” local authorities—created
anxiety.<a id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>It had been widely prevalent in Europe in 1865, and had
even shown itself in England, and it stirred into spasmodic
and panicky activity the local authorities of London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>In Lambeth a systematic house inspection was inaugurated;
987 houses were examined—735 of them required
sanitary improvements.</p>

<p>In Bethnal Green 2,018 were inspected—955 required
cleansing and purification.</p>

<p>In many other parishes and districts extra sanitary work
was done. The disease made no further demonstration in
the winter, but in April, 1866, a case was reported from
Bristol, then one from Swansea—then from other places;
and in July the Privy Council issued Orders in Council
putting the Disease Prevention Act in force in the metropolitan
area.</p>

<p>On July 18th, from Poplar, the first case in the metropolis
was reported. Two days later an alarming number of
cases in parts of East London.</p>

<p>Regulations were issued by the Privy Council defining and
requiring the specific services which local authorities ought
to render the public.</p>

<p>Some parishes appointed extra Sanitary Inspectors. Thus
in Hackney, where there had been but one, four additional
ones were appointed; in St. James’ two; in Camberwell
two; in Lambeth two; in St. Mary, Newington, five extra
were appointed. Some of the work which was reported
brings into striking prominence the extraordinary inefficiency
hitherto of the authorities in dealing with insanitary
houses as well as the neglect into which houses had
been let fall, and which was tolerated by those who were
responsible for the health of their districts.</p>

<p>In Lambeth 6,935 houses were inspected in 1866; 3,983
improvements were effected.</p>

<p>In Camberwell, 5,594 houses were inspected; in 4,324
sanitary work had to be done.</p>

<p>In St. Mary, <span class="no-break">Newington:—</span></p>

<p>“A house-to-house visitation was commenced August 4th,
and concluded on November 20th, in which period the Sub-Inspectors
called at 12,919 houses.</p>

<p>“A record was thus obtained of the condition of nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
every house in the parish. The house-to-house visitation
was carried out with but little real opposition, and with a
great deal of satisfaction…. Strict impartiality was the
rule of action, and all classes and those in every station
were alike subject to inquiry.”</p>

<p>As the summer went on, the mortality from the cholera
increased—it reached its acme on August 1st, when there
were 204 deaths from it, and in the week ending August 4th
when the total of 1,053 was reached.<a id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>During the 23 weeks of its prevalence 5,548 persons died—of
whom 3,909 died in the East Districts alone, and 702
on the South side of the river.</p>

<p>And by the end of the year it had gone. That the mortality
should have been so much smaller than on previous
visitations was attributed to the fact that London was
unquestionably less filthy at the time of this outbreak.</p>

<p>“A comparison of the mortality with that of former
cholera years,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for
St. Giles’, “demonstrates that sanitary work—imperfect as it
is—has deprived the disease of much of its power.”</p>

<p>“The power,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for
Fulham, “of sanitary arrangements to check the progress of
such a formidable disease was clearly evidenced.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“I believe the great sanitary improvements effected in
the parish in providing proper drainage, abolishing many
miles of open stinking ditches, and the removal of other
nuisances, rendered an outbreak of cholera, such as experienced
in former years, very improbable…. Moreover, by
the employment of sanitary arrangements for treating the
sick, Lambeth and other parts of the metropolis were saved
from the ravages of the pestilence experienced on former
occasions.”</p>

<p>That the epidemic had been as disastrous as it was, was,
however, attributed to “an illegal and most culpable act of
the East London Water Company. In contravention of the
4th Section of the Metropolis Water Act of 1852 that
company distributed for public use a water (and a most
improper water) which had not passed through its filter
beds; and strong evidence was adduced to show that the
outbreak was occasioned by this illegal and most culpable
act.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>One result of this epidemic was to demonstrate, at the
cost of thousands of lives, that the system of private water
companies supplying the community with this necessity of
life was absolutely opposed to the interests of the community.</p>

<p>Dr. Simon, in summing up his report (1869) on the water
supply to the metropolis, <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“I have been anxious to show what enormous risks to
the public are implied in any slovenly administration of
water supplies: yet as regards the London supply, what
imperfect obedience to the law, and in some cases what
flagrant and systematic disobedience was exhibited (at the
time of the cholera outbreak in East London in 1866); and
above all what criminal indifference to the public safety was
illustrated by the proceedings of the Southwark and Vauxhall
Company.”</p>

<p>As regarded this latter <span class="no-break">company:—</span></p>

<p>“Not only had there been the long-standing gross inefficiency
of the apparatus of subsidence and filtration, but the
administrators of the supply had from time to time dispensed
to a great extent with even a pretence of filtration, and
during some time had, worst of all, either negligently or
wilfully distributed as part of their supply the interdicted
tidal water of Battersea Beach.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that the public is hitherto very imperfectly
protected against certain extreme dangers which the malfeasance
of a water company may suddenly bring upon great
masses of population. Its colossal power of life and death
is something for which till recently there has been no precedent
in the history of the world; and such a power, in
whatever hands it is vested, ought most sedulously to be
guarded against abuse.”</p>

<p>Cholera was once more a blessing in disguise, though it
seems hard that the sacrifice of thousands of lives should
have been required to move Government and Parliament to
fresh measures for the protection of the people from it and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the other deadly diseases which unceasingly worked such
deadly havoc among them. But the proof given by it was
so overwhelming and decisive as to the insufficiency of the
existing sanitary law, and the inefficiency of the local
authorities, that Parliament felt forced to take action. The
measures taken were of such increased comprehensiveness
and stringency, that the passing of the Sanitary Act of 1866<a id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
marked another great step in the sanitary evolution of
London.</p>

<p>The Act applied to England and Wales—and this time
actually included the metropolis.</p>

<p>The previous definition of the term “nuisance” was
enlarged, and “overcrowding” was now for the first time
declared to be a “nuisance.”</p>

<p>“Any house or part of a house so overcrowded as to be
dangerous or prejudicial to the health of the inmates” was
henceforward a “nuisance” and punishable as such. And
it was further enacted that “where two convictions for
overcrowding of a house, or for the occupation of a cellar
as a separate tenement dwelling-place” should have taken
place within three months, it should be lawful for the
magistrate to direct the closing of such premises for such
time as he might deem necessary.</p>

<p>Under another extension of the term “nuisance” the
industrial classes got the shadowy boon of all factories,
workshops, and workplaces (not already under special Acts),
being made subject to the sanitary supervision of the local
authorities; and those authorities were given power to
inspect such places to ascertain if they were kept in a cleanly
state, were properly ventilated, and not overcrowded so as
to be dangerous or prejudicial to the health of the inmates.</p>

<p>A section in the Act aimed at the inefficiency and inaction
of the local authorities, and made it obligatory (no longer
optional) upon them to make inspection of their districts.</p>

<p>“It shall be the duty of the Nuisance Authority to make
from time to time, either by itself or its officers, inspection
of the district, with a view to ascertain what nuisances exist
calling for abatement under the powers of the Nuisances
Removal Acts, and to enforce the provisions of the said Acts
in order to cause the abatement thereof.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p>An effort was also made to check the spread of infectious
disease by giving the local authority considerable powers
as regarded disinfection. It was enacted that the local
authority might provide a proper place for the disinfection
of clothing and bedding which might have been rendered
liable to communicate disease to others; and the authority
was empowered to maintain carriages for the conveyance
to hospital of persons suffering under any infectious or
contagious disease. A blow was struck at the iniquitous
but common practice of letting a room where there had
been dangerous infectious disorder, until it had been disinfected.
And provision was made for the establishment
of a hospital for the reception of the sick.</p>

<p>All these were most considerable reforms, and would have
been most useful had they been given effect to and properly
enforced.</p>

<p>The most important and wide-reaching provision of the
Act was that directed against overcrowding.</p>

<p>The 35th Section enacted that regulations might be made by
the Sanitary Authority (in other words, the Vestry or District
Board) for fixing the number of persons who might occupy
a house, or part of a house, let in lodgings, or occupied by
members of more than one family. Houses so let were to
be registered by the Vestry. The regulations could fix a
certain number of cubic feet of air space which should be
available for each person. By this means the number of
persons who might live in a house, and in the rooms of the
house, could be limited.</p>

<p>That was the plan—simple enough in appearance—which
Parliament devised for contending with the great evil of
overcrowding.</p>

<p>And then, as regarded the sanitation of the houses when
registered, it enacted that regulations should contain provisions
for their being put into and kept in a clean and
wholesome state. And to secure this being done, regulations
were made for their inspection.</p>

<p>It was an original and comprehensive scheme of reform.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
It struck at the root of the two great evils—overcrowding
and insanitary dwellings; at overcrowding, by the limitation
of the number of persons inhabiting a house, or part of a
house, and at insanitary dwellings by a series of regulations
enforcing the necessary measures for a decent standard of sanitation.
But it was something far more than this. It was the
declaration of principles of the utmost importance. It was
a declaration of the principle that the responsibility for the
condition of the “houses let in lodgings” should be on the
shoulders of the “owner” of the house. It was the declaration
of the principle that the “owner” should not be allowed
to use his property to the detriment, to the injury of the
public. It affirmed, so far as London lodging or tenement
houses were concerned, the great principle, abhorred by so
many “owners,” that “property has its duties as well as its
rights.”</p>

<p>The Act was, however, even more remarkable for the
recognition it contained of another principle of vital importance
to the people of London—the principle of central
authority over local sanitary authorities who neglected their
duties.</p>

<p>Hitherto the local authorities were practically their own
masters, and could with absolute impunity neglect to put
the provisions of the existing health laws into operation;
and “often their inaction had been an absolutely inexcusable
neglect of duty.”</p>

<p>A power of appeal against this inaction was given.
Where complaint was made to a Secretary of State that
a nuisance authority had made default in enforcing the
provisions of the Nuisances Removal Acts, he could, if
satisfied after inquiry that the authority had been guilty
of the alleged default, make an order limiting a time
for the performance of the duty, and if the duty was not
performed within that time, he could appoint some person
to perform the duty and charge the costs to the authority.
And where the local authority had made default in instituting
proceedings against some sanitary law breaker,
he could order the chief police officer to institute them.
These provisions were a recognition of the fact, long
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
patent to even the blindest, that local authorities did not
do their duty, and of the necessity of devising a means of
securing that a necessary public duty should be done.</p>

<p>The fact was emphasised a few years later by the Royal
Sanitary Commissioners, who pointed out (1871) <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“However local the administration of affairs, a central
authority will nevertheless be always necessary in order to
keep the local executive everywhere in action.”</p>

<p>The real underlying truth now beginning to be discerned
was that in the matter of health or disease, London could
not be treated in bits, each governed by an independent
body, but must be regarded as, what it really was, one
single entity or whole.</p>

<p>In another way also was the principle of central authority
very clearly affirmed. The Vestries were not to have a free
hand in making their regulations under the 35th Section.
Any they made had to be approved by a Secretary of State.</p>

<p>This was a considerable limitation of the freedom of the
Vestries, but it secured more or less uniformity in the powers
of the local authorities in this particular matter.</p>

<p>But the vigorous administration by all the local authorities
of the laws passed to secure the health of the public, was
even more greatly to be desired; for, from force of circumstances,
the consequences—one way or the other—could not
be confined to the sphere of action of each local authority.</p>

<p>The lives and welfare of the inhabitants of this vast city
are so closely, so inextricably interwoven that, in matters
affecting the public health, the action or inaction of one
authority may vitally affect the health and the lives, not
alone of its neighbours, but even of the people of the city
as a whole. Disease and death are no respecters of
municipal boundaries, and are not hemmed in or restrained
by lines drawn upon maps or recorded in Acts of
Parliament.</p>

<p>This community of interest of the inhabitants of London
was, however, scarcely, if at all, recognised by the general
public—it was but seldom the motive to action by the local
authorities—but some of the Medical Officers of Health
now and then referred to it in their reports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for Mile-End-Old-Town
pointed out (1863) <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“An untrapped drain, an overcrowded house, an unventilated
alley, a rotting dungheap, or a foul closet, may
spread disease and sorrow in an entire neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Paddington
pointed out (1870–1) <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“The danger of harbouring a contagious disease is not
confined to the individual suffering—it is a matter that
concerns the community.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel
wrote <span class="no-break">(1865):—</span></p>

<p>“Here I would remark, that a uniform system of
inspection of all the houses in the several districts in
London which are let out in separate tenements should be
repeatedly and systematically adopted; for if all the
Vestries and local Boards do not act together in this
important matter, hotbeds of epidemic diseases will remain
undiscovered which will serve as centres from whence such
diseases may emanate, and extend over the entire
metropolis. The whole population of London, therefore,
is interested in the prompt removal of nuisances.”</p>

<p>Immediately on the passing of the Act some of the
Vestries made efforts to deal with overcrowding under the
Section which enacted <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“Any house so overcrowded as to be dangerous or
prejudicial to the health of the inmates” is to be considered
a “nuisance.”</p>

<p>That, however, was only a temporary remedy, and
affected only overcrowding. Section 35 went to the root
of the matter when it insisted that in addition to the
prevention of overcrowding, the house in which the people
lived should be kept clean and in sanitary condition.</p>

<p>“The very foundation of our sanitary structure,” wrote
the Medical Officer of Health for St. George-the-Martyr,
“depends upon the right housing of the poor.”</p>

<p>The Section 35 was promptly put in force by a few of the
Vestries—Chelsea and Hackney being the first to make
Regulations and to enforce them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the Regulations, whenever the Vestry deemed it
desirable to put them in force in respect to any house
let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one
family, the number of persons allowed to live in that
house was fixed on a basis of 300 cubic feet of air for each
adult for sleeping, or 350 for living and sleeping, and the
owner had to reduce the number of lodgers to the number
so fixed on receiving notice to that effect.</p>

<p>The Regulations further directed <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“The owner of such house shall cause the walls and
ceilings of every room, and of the staircase and passages,
and yards of such house to be well and sufficiently coloured
or limewashed, or otherwise thoroughly cleansed once (at
least) in every year.</p>

<p>“He shall cause every room and the passages to be
ventilated.</p>

<p>“He shall provide such accommodation for washing, and
such a supply of water for the use of the lodgers as shall
be satisfactory to the Vestry’s Officers;” and sundry and
numerous minor directions.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health (Chelsea), after the first
year’s work, reported that the number of houses in the
parish inhabited by two or more families was very great,
and in many cases their condition was deplorable, and it
was found necessary to embrace whole streets as well as
courts and alleys in the registration.</p>

<p>By 1869 the registration in Chelsea had been completed,
and in 1870 the Medical Officer of Health wrote: “I have
seen no reason to alter my opinion of the beneficial action
of the measure by which we have been able to bring under
direct and constant supervision the majority of the houses
occupied by the poorer classes in this parish….”</p>

<p>The most satisfactory results followed also in Hackney.</p>

<p>Its Medical Officer of Health reported in 1867 that
nearly 5,000 houses had been measured and examined, and
in a large proportion of cases the numbers of persons
allowed to inhabit them had been fixed. And as to the
result of the enforcement of the Regulations, he wrote
(1869): “A very large number of families now occupy two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
rooms who formerly lived and slept in one. The gain in
health and morality has therefore been considerable.”</p>

<p>Poplar was another of the District Boards which made
and enforced the Regulations. The Medical Officer of
Health for the north part of the District reported <span class="no-break">(1868):—</span></p>

<p>“Extensive improvements have been already effected,
but the work must still be systematically continued, for
even when every house in the district has been put into
good sanitary state (which is far from being the case as
yet), it will be necessary to maintain a constant and watchful
system of re-inspection to ensure their being kept in
order.</p>

<p>“Of the 1,610 houses inspected nearly all required more
or less sanitary improvement, and 630 were registered as
containing more than one family, and therefore coming
under the Board’s regulations as to registration.”</p>

<p>But if a few of the Vestries made real efforts to utilise
the Act, others of them either made only a pretence of
doing so, or refused altogether.</p>

<p>The reports of the Medical Officer of Health for St.
Giles’ (1866–7) present a typical picture of the attitude
and conduct of these bodies.</p>

<p>“A most important amendment of the sanitary laws
was made by the ‘Sanitary Act,’ of which Section 35 gives
precisely the powers which, not last year only, but every
year since the constitution of the Board, the Medical Officer
has demanded for the efficient discharge of his functions in
respect of houses inhabited by the poorer classes. That
section has given to the local authority the power of making
bye-laws for the regulation of sub-let houses, and of
enforcing the observance of its rules by penalties.</p>

<p>“In St. Giles’ District, it is this class of houses almost
exclusively which need the supervision of the sanitary
authorities, and which become without that supervision
nests of filth and disease.</p>

<p>“Accordingly, soon after the passing of the Sanitary Act,
bye-laws were adopted by the Board, and sanctioned by the
Secretary of State for the regulation of sub-let houses….</p>

<p>“The Board proceeded to inform owners of all sub-let
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
houses that such houses must be registered in conformity
with the Regulation. The intention of the Board was to
apply with all proper discrimination, but quite universally
and impartially, the powers vested in them in regard to
sub-let houses…. The systematic application of these
powers by the Board would have done for sub-let houses
what the systematic application of the police of their
powers under other Acts had done for common lodging-houses.
Cleanliness and decency would have been universally
secured, and would have been maintained with a
minimum of inspection by a fine for every gross violation
of the regulations.</p>

<p>“But against a system that should work thus directly and
efficiently to the sanitary good of the district, the interests
of numbers of house-owners and agents were at once
arrayed, and these speedily organised an influential deputation
to the Board.</p>

<p>“The opposite interests, those of the families dwelling in
the close and miserable rooms of these sub-let houses,
found no organised expression.</p>

<p>“The Board resolved to recall the notices which had been
issued for a systematic registration, and to apply their
powers, in the first instance, only to selected instances of
flagrant and continuous sanitary neglect.”</p>

<p>And yet overcrowding in tenement-houses in St. Giles’
was dreadful.</p>

<p>Here are some instances of it on the authority of the
Medical Officer of Health in 1869.</p>

<p>“These houses have for the greater part a family in
every room.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="p1">In Whitechapel (1867), rules and regulations were
adopted by the Board.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health,
the Act was permissive, not compulsory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“I brought under the notice of your Board several houses
which in my opinion ought to be registered.</p>

<p>“… The Board having reserved to itself the power of
determining as to the propriety of causing any house to be
placed upon the register, this enactment, which was
framed not only for the improvement of the moral and
physical condition of the poor, but for the benefit of the
whole community, has been carried into effect in only one
instance.”</p>

<p>In Islington, draft Regulations were prepared, but it
does not appear that they were ever adopted.</p>

<p>In Paddington, the Vestry decided against putting the
Regulations in force.</p>

<p>In Westminster, “such obstacles were offered by the
holders of small property” to the Regulations that they
were not enforced.</p>

<p>And on the south side of the river the story was very
much the same.</p>

<p>The sting of the enactment was that it put house-owners
to the expense of putting the house into, and maintaining
it in, habitable and sanitary repair, and to the expense of
annually painting or lime-washing it; the provision of
proper ventilation—of sanitary and washing accommodation,
and for a supply of water: in fact, of doing to the
houses that which was essential for the health of their
occupants. The Regulations simplified and shortened, and
made more effective, the processes for enforcing penalties
for breaches of the sanitary laws—all which was of course
unpalatable to the sanitary law-breaker.</p>

<p>And so the great bulk of the local authorities would have
nothing to do with this 35th Section or its Regulations.</p>

<p>The law was not compulsory, but permissive—and they
availed themselves of that permission.</p>

<p>But the Vestries and District Boards who took no action,
and allowed the principal provision of the Act to be a dead
letter, proved by their conduct their deliberate determination
not to impose what was a just expense upon the “owners,”
even though the not doing so should result in a frightful
annual sacrifice of human life, and in an untold amount of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
human suffering and misery, and a long train of physical
and moral evils of the very worst character.</p>

<p>That the Act had been successfully administered by some
two or three Vestries proved that it was quite a workable
measure—so no excuse could be raised on that ground by
the recalcitrant Vestries.</p>

<p>Their attitude is an irrefutable proof of their selfish indifference
to human suffering where it clashed with the
“rights of property,” and of their incapacity for the position
they held as guardians and trustees of the people.</p>

<p>“The slaughter-houses and cow-houses are ordered to be
whited at least twice a year, while the houses of the poor
are allowed to remain for years without this important
means of purification.”</p>

<p>The problem of overcrowding was, undoubtedly, a most
difficult one—and some of the Medical Officers of Health
were realising how difficult it was to treat with any hope of
success.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for Bethnal Green
set forth the state of his parish in <span class="no-break">1867:—</span></p>

<p>“The population of Bethnal Green has now nearly
reached 120,000, and we have no more house room than
heretofore. The consequence is that overcrowding is as
great as ever; and although the Public Health Act of 1866
was framed to obviate this great evil, it is practically unworkable,
owing mainly to high rents (which in some cases
have increased as much as 50 per cent.), dearness of provisions,
scarcity of employment, and the imposition of taxes
for the first time upon the tenant; and many families who
could ordinarily afford to occupy a whole house have been
obliged to let lodgings; others who have occupied two
rooms have been obliged to put up with one; and where
overcrowding has existed, and the law enforced, the people
have merely removed to other houses and thus perpetuated
the evil which it was the intention of the Legislature to
obviate.”</p>

<p>But doing nothing while overcrowding got worse was not
likely to make the problem less difficult.</p>

<p>Except, then, in a few parishes overcrowding was permitted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to pursue its own course unchecked, to the great benefit of
the various “owners,” and to the great misery of great
masses of the people, and the evil extended itself year by
year and became steadily acuter.</p>

<p>And this, too, after Parliament had placed in the hands
of the local authorities large powers specially designed for
coping with an evil which was eating into the very vitals of
the community.</p>

<p>So rapid was the increase of population that the increase
in the number of houses did little to mitigate the over-crowding;
nor was the construction of the majority of the
houses conducive to the health of those who went to inhabit
them.</p>

<p>London ground was being rapidly covered with buildings.</p>

<p>“Many large tracts of our formerly open spaces have
been rapidly covered, nay densely packed with buildings.</p>

<p>“The operations of the builder have annihilated acres of
garden ground by the hundred.”</p>

<p>“Little garden plots, green spots, open spaces, were being
absorbed and swallowed up one after another, and covered
with houses….</p>

<p>“Apparently each builder does that which seems good in
his own eyes.”</p>

<p>Paddington afforded an interesting example of this
growth. A space near Ranelagh Road, about 25 acres,
had almost all been built upon within the last 15–20 years.
The streets were 40 feet wide. Here were 900 houses
packed with 12,000 people, or 469 persons to the acre
(1871). And another example near Paddington Road, where
275 houses had been built, and the population was
493 to the acre, <span class="no-break">showing—</span></p>

<p>“A high density of population such as ought not to have
been tolerated under a wise municipal policy.”</p>

<p>The rapidity of the increase was extraordinary. In
Lambeth in the year 1866–7, 1,078 houses were erected.
In Battersea in 1868–9, 1,530 houses were erected—a large
number of which were filled with people within a few days
or weeks of their completion.</p>

<p>The newness of a house, however, gave no guarantee of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
its sanitary fitness, and a great proportion of them were of
the most objectionable and insanitary description. All the
art and craft of the speculating builder was too often
exercised to evade such legal provisions as there were for
the protection of the public, and to get the largest profits
he could for the worst constructed house, and the result
was that very many of the new houses were little better
than the worst of the old ones.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the law was very ineffective to prevent
this. As was pointed out by the Medical Officer of
Health for Fulham (1871), the sanitary legislation for
the metropolis had never been accompanied by an amalgamation
of the Building Act with the general sanitary statutes.</p>

<p>“The Building Act still works an independent course,
and it is not too much to say of it that, whilst its provisions
deal strictly with the strength and quality of bricks and
mortar, they utterly fail to ensure for us dwellings, especially
for the working classes, which have the least pretensions to
perfection in sanitary conditions. A large number of habitations
of this description have been completed and occupied
during the last few years both in Fulham and Hammersmith,
and take the place of our former fever dens in
fostering disease. Unfortunately the Sanitary Authorities
see these wretched structures raised before their eyes, and
have no power to check their progress. It is truly to be
hoped that this anomaly will soon be remedied.”</p>

<p>Such as the houses were, however, they were quickly inhabited.
The Medical Officer of Health for Paddington gives
a graphic description of the result in his parish <span class="no-break">(1871):—</span></p>

<p>“There has been for some years a large influx of persons,
mostly of the working class, coming from over-crowded and
unwholesome houses of other districts of the metropolis.
Large numbers of the newly-built houses being let out in
tenements and single rooms attract a class of persons
barely able to obtain necessaries of life; amongst these are
not a few of intemperate and demoralised habits, with
feeble vital stamina, consequently there is, and will be, a
larger proportion of sickness, chronic pauperism, and death
in the parish than formerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“This deterioration of race has for some time been recognised
by Medical Officers of Health.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“It must be remembered that most of the working people
are fixed to the spot, and cannot get a periodical change of
climate, or remove from a locality in the event of impending
ill-health, or of contagious disease breaking out near them.</p>

<p>“It is of no avail to lament over the laws of absolute
necessity, but all parties should combine in a demand for
that even-handed justice to the working ranks which, though
it may not interfere with a stern destiny which confines
them to a life of toil, is bound at least to provide that
the theatre of that toil shall be free from the pollutions that
endanger the functions of life, and uncontaminated by contagion
and death.</p>

<p>“I must say it is a scandal to the present constitution of
society that the reverse of this continues from year to year
in spite of all suggestions of Medical Officers of Health, and
the warnings of experience. In vain does one plague after
another ravage the family of industrial orders, and like
doomed men they stand amidst the harvest of death
looking earnestly, but in vain, to the Legislature for
that help which no other power can give. Parents,
children, and friends, drop around them, the victims of a
poisoned atmosphere; while they hear and feel successive
warnings, the irrevocable law of necessity fixes them to the
spot, and they cannot flee from the danger.”</p>

<p>The Central Authority, the Metropolitan Board of Works,
had, during the decade, been doing much useful work
affecting the public health, of London, in addition to its
great work, the great system of main drainage.</p>

<p>It had undertaken and had completed several large street
improvements by 1870, intended to provide new and improved
means of access from one part of the town to
another.</p>

<p>“The Board had to supply the deficiencies resulting from
centuries of neglect: it had also to keep pace as well as
it could with the wants of the ever-increasing population,
and the needs of a traffic which grew relatively even more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
than the population,” and each work contributed to the
improvement of the public health, by facilitating and increasing
the circulation of air in crowded neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>Another matter, important also in reference to the health
of the metropolis, had also occupied their attention, namely,
the acquisition or preservation of open spaces in London
for public recreation and enjoyment.</p>

<p>A piece of land, of over 100 acres in extent, was acquired
and opened to the public as Finsbury Park in 1869; and on
the south side of the river, in Rotherhithe, some 63 acres of
land were purchased in 1864, and converted into a public
park a few years later.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of London there were a number of commons
and other tracts of open ground available for public
resort, to which the public had no legal rights, and which
were rapidly being absorbed by railway companies or
builders. London was thus in danger of losing open spaces
which were urgently required in the interests of the public
health.</p>

<p>Parliament, after an inquiry by Select Committee, passed
the “Metropolitan Commons Act”<a id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> in 1866, which prescribed
a mode of procedure under which the commons in
the neighbourhood of London could be permanently procured
for the people of London, and the Metropolitan Board set to
work to procure them. The acquisition of Hampstead
Heath was happily arranged in 1870.</p>

<p>Another great work was also undertaken by the Central
Authority—namely, the embankment of the Thames.</p>

<p>The offensive state of the river had been greatly enhanced
by the large areas left dry at low water on which sewage
matter collected and putrefied; and the only way of removing
this cause of mischief was by confining the current
within a narrower channel.</p>

<p>Parliament passed an Act in 1863, entrusting its execution
to the Metropolitan Board, and the work was soon after
commenced.</p>

<p>Thus in these matters, all of which were closely associated
with the public health, the sanitary evolution of London was
progressing, and the Board was giving visible demonstration
of the necessity of that which had so long been denied
to London—namely, a central governing authority to deal
with matters affecting London as a whole.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>
<p>The Board, in their report for 1865–6, stated they were:
“Deeply sensible of what remained to be done to remedy
the neglect of past ages, and to render the metropolis
worthy of its position as the chief city of the Empire;” but
they were hampered by the want of means to enable them to
carry out desired improvements.</p>

<p>“It cannot be questioned,” they wrote, “that direct taxation
now falls very heavily upon the occupiers of property
in the metropolis…. It appears to the Board that the
most equitable and practicable mode of raising the necessary
funds would be by imposing a portion of the burden on the
owners of property. It cannot be denied that the interest
of the latter in metropolitan improvements is much greater
than that of temporary occupiers, and yet at the present
time, the occupiers of property in the metropolis bear almost
the whole cost of the improvements effected by the Board.
It is hoped that the representations made by the Board will
satisfy the Legislature of the injustice of the present state
of things, and lead to some equitable remedy.”</p>

<p>The visitation of cholera was doubtless in the main
accountable for the excess of energy displayed by Parliament
about this period in matters affecting the public health.</p>

<p>In the same session that the Sanitary Act was passed, a
measure of considerable importance to the consumers of
water in London was passed, though many years would
elapse before its effect would be appreciable. This was “The
Thames Purification Act.”</p>

<p>“Whereas … the sewage of towns situate on the river
Thames above the metropolis is carried into the river, and
thereby its waters are polluted and the health and comfort
of the inhabitants of the valley of the river below those
towns of the metropolis are affected,” powers were given for
the diversion therefrom of the sewage of Oxford, Reading,
Kingston, Richmond, &amp;c., &amp;c., “whose cloacal contributions
to the stream were distributed to masses of the people of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
London.” No less than 56 towns, it was said, cast their
impurities into the river.</p>

<p>And in the following year the scope of the Thames Conservancy
Board was extended and very stringent care
exercised to prevent unnecessary pollution of the river. And
in 1868 the river Lea, another of the water suppliers, was
placed under a Conservancy Board.</p>

<p>In 1867 an Act of far-reaching consequence was passed,
making vaccination compulsory. In 1836 an Act<a id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> dealing
with this matter laid it down that the parent of a child,
or the occupier of the house in which a child was born,
might, within 40 days, give notice to the Registrar as to the
vaccination of the child. There was no punishment for the
neglect to do so, and no penalty for refusal to give the
Registrar the information.</p>

<p>This new Act, which came into operation on the 1st
of January, 1868, enacted <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“Every child shall be vaccinated within three months of
its birth.”</p>

<p>The Act was to be administered by the Poor Law Authorities;
and Boards of Guardians might appoint public
vaccinators and establish vaccination stations.</p>

<p>In 1867, also, another Act of very great consequence was
passed dealing with one important element in the sanitary
evolution of London, to which no reference has yet been
made, namely, the provision of hospitals for the isolation
of infectious or contagious disease, for the prevention of
mortality, and for the speedy restoration of the sick to
health.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, no part of sanitary work requiring more
constant attention than the protection of the community
from the spread of infectious diseases, and this is best
secured by hospitals affording proper provision for isolation
and treatment of infectious cases.</p>

<p>Next to the adoption of proper measures for the prevention
of disease, a suitable provision for the speedy restoration
of the sick to health is obviously of the greatest importance
to the community.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>
<p>So far as the absolutely destitute were concerned, all had,
by the law of England, subject to certain conditions, right
to food, shelter, and medical attendance; and they accordingly
received gratuitous medical treatment at workhouses,
or dispensaries, and in sick wards.</p>

<p>Indeed, any person suffering from an infectious disease
might, if willing to become a pauper, take advantage of such
provision as was made by the Guardians of the Poor, the
provision being imperfectly isolated wards and buildings
attached to the several Metropolitan Workhouses and
Infirmaries. Those not so willing were compelled to remain
at home, a source of danger to those around them, and if
poor, with insufficient medical attendance and nourishment.</p>

<p>For a long time the only special provision for certain
infectious diseases for the whole of London was that in the
London Fever, and the London Smallpox Hospitals, both
of which were maintained by private charity.</p>

<p>Happily, where neither the State nor the local authorities
did anything, charity stepped in, and on a larger scale supplied
an inevitable want; and medical charities grew up to
give relief in time of sickness to those of the working classes
of society who were unable to provide for themselves, but
this was mostly for non-infectious or non-contagious
diseases.</p>

<p>None of the Vestries or District Boards gave any sign of
making provision for those who were not paupers, although
the duty of giving opportunity for isolation of infectious
persons whose diseases made them dangerous to others, be
they paupers or not, devolved upon them under the
Sanitary Act of 1866 as the Sanitary Authorities concerned
in the prevention of the extension of disease.</p>

<p>“Indeed it must be admitted,” wrote the Medical Officer
of Health for Chelsea some years later, “that the Vestries
never recognised their responsibilities (as sanitary authorities)
from the very first.”</p>

<p>Grievous scandals having occurred in the treatment of the
sick in many of the metropolitan workhouses, the Government
of 1867 decided on a great measure of reform. Once
more the necessity of central government had to be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
recognised, and by the Metropolitan Poor Act of 1867 a
Board—elected by the Poor Law Guardians, who themselves
were elected bodies—was created as a central
authority to relieve Poor Law Guardians of the care of and
treatment of paupers suffering from fever and smallpox who
could not be properly treated in workhouses, and to provide
for their treatment and accommodation, as well as that of
the harmless insane of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The Board was entitled the Metropolitan Asylums Board,
and consisted of 73 members; 55 of whom were elected by
the various Boards of Guardians in London, and the
remaining 18 being nominated by the Home Secretary.</p>

<p>In the early stage of its existence its duties were strictly
confined to those of the pauper class suffering from these
diseases.<a id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Admission to its hospitals could be obtained only
on orders issued by the relieving officers, and those admitted
became, if they were not so already, “pauperised” by
admission and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> paupers; but later its scope was
extended, and it became the Hospital Authority for
infectious diseases in London, and afforded another illustration
of the necessity for having one central authority for
matters relating to the public health of the inhabitants of
the metropolis.</p>

<p>The erection of hospitals was at once commenced. The
first was opened in January, 1870, and the isolated treatment
of many cases of infectious disease was of great
benefit to the community.</p>

<p>In 1867, too, Parliament again dealt with the condition
of the workers in Factories and Workshops. The legislation
dealt with the kingdom as a whole, but inasmuch as
London was so great a manufacturing city, it affected also
the masses of the working population of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The Commissioners on Children’s Employment, who had
been at work since 1862, had completed their inquiry, and
made many recommendations, and in the concluding part of
their fifth report, dated 1866, they <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“We heartily trust that we may have thus, in some
degree, contributed to bring the time nearer when so many
hundreds of thousands of your Majesty’s poorer subjects of
the working classes—especially the very young and those of
the tenderer sex—will be relieved from the totally unnecessary
burden and oppression of overtime, and night work;
will be confined to the reasonable and natural limits of the
factory hours … will perform their daily labour under
more favourable sanitary conditions, breathing purer air,
amid greater cleanliness, and protected against causes
specially injurious to health and tending to depress their
vigour and shorten their lives.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>
<p>Only in 1867 was factory legislation at last of an
approximately general character.</p>

<p>“Fully two-thirds of the century in which England’s
industrial supremacy swept to its climax was allowed to
pass before even an attempt was made to regulate on sound
general principles the recognised and inevitable workings of
unchecked individualism in the industrial field.”<a id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The Act of 1867<a id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> made better provision for regulating
the hours during which children, young persons, and
women, were to be permitted to labour in any manufacturing
process conducted in an establishment where fifty or
more persons are employed—the regulation being in the
direction of less onerous conditions of labour.</p>

<p>And by another Act passed at the same time—“The
Workshop Regulation Act, 1867,”<a id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> the protection afforded
to workers in factories was extended to workers in smaller
establishments, so far as regarded the regulations relating to
the hours of labour to children, young persons, and women.</p>

<p>“Workshop” was defined <span class="no-break">as—</span></p>

<p>“Any room or place whatever (not a factory or bakehouse)
in which any handicraft is carried on by any child,
young person, or woman, and to which the person employing
them had a right of access and control.”</p>

<p>No child under 8 was to be employed, and none between
8 and 13 was to be employed more than six and a half
hours a day—and sundry other directions. The workshops,
moreover, were to be kept in a proper sanitary state, and
the administration of the sanitary provisions of the Act was
placed in the hands of the local authorities—the Home
Office Inspectors having concurrent jurisdiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>These Acts had a two-fold effect in the direction of
sanitary evolution: the improvement of the sanitary conditions
under which the people worked, and the prohibition of
work entailing consequences detrimental to the physical
well-being of the workers.</p>

<p>Their effect would have been of the greatest value in
London had they been vigorously enforced. Some of the
Medical Officers of Health endeavoured to enforce the Act.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for the Strand reported
to his employers <span class="no-break">(1868–9):—</span></p>

<p>“During the past year the provisions of the Workshops
Regulation Act, 1867, have, so far as practicable, been
enforced.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for St. George, Hanover
Square, wrote <span class="no-break">(1870–1):—</span></p>

<p>“I have endeavoured to carry out the Workshops Act by
the abatement of overcrowding, by enforcing due ventilation,
and closing at the legal time, so as to prevent the
scandal and suffering of dressmakers still being compelled
to toil for 16 hours.”</p>

<p>But the silence of others on the subject told its own tale
and pointed its own moral. Active inspection was essential
for success, but inspection was not encouraged by the
Vestries or District Boards, and the intentions of the
Legislature were once more frustrated by the failure of
the local authorities to do their duty.</p>

<p>After four years Parliament took the duty away from
their incapable hands and transferred it to the Factory
Department of the Home Office.</p>

<p>One other Act of importance Parliament also passed
about this time, “The Artizans’ and Labourers’ Dwellings
Act, 1868.”</p>

<p>Sanitary legislation has as yet done little more for old
property, and the whole of Central London was old property,
than to improve the drainage, and occasionally to
cleanse or whitewash some small fraction of it; and there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
remained the fact that numerous districts or conglomerations
of houses were unreformable, and when the most was
done to them that could be done under the law were still
unfit for human habitation.</p>

<p>In the previous year a Bill had been introduced into
Parliament by Mr. <span class="no-break">Torrens:—</span></p>

<p>“The objects of which were, first, to provide means for
taking down or improving dwellings occupied by working
men which were unfit for human habitation; and secondly,
for the building and maintenance of better dwellings instead.
But the Act of 1868 retained the former only; the latter
having been struck out of the Bill during its progress
through Parliament.</p>

<p>“The intention of Parliament was to provide the means
whereby local authorities might secure the effectual repair
of dilapidated dwellings, or, when necessary, their gradual
reconstruction.”<a id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The Act conferred powers far exceeding any heretofore
possessed by the local authority for effectually dealing with
houses unfit for human habitation.</p>

<p>“On the report of the Medical Officer of Health that any
inhabited building was in a condition dangerous to health,
so as to be unfit for human habitation, the Vestry, after
certain inquiries, &amp;c., was to have power to order the owner
to remove the premises, and, in default, themselves to
remove them; or they might order the owner to execute
the necessary structural alterations, and in default, might
either shut up or pull down the premises, or themselves
execute the necessary work at the owner’s expense.”<a id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The Act proceeded upon the principle that the responsibility
of maintaining his houses in proper condition falls upon the
owner, and that if he failed in his duty the law is justified
in stepping in and compelling him to perform it. It further
assumed that houses unfit for human habitation ought not to
be used as dwellings, but ought, in the interests of the public,
to be closed, and demolished, and to be subsequently rebuilt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Use began to be made of the Act soon after its passing,
but the operations under it can be more conveniently
described in the following chapter.</p>

<p>The energy of Parliament had a most beneficial effect,
and many of the Medical Officers of Health bore testimony
to the encouraging sanitary progress which was being made.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for Fulham wrote
<span class="no-break">(1868):—</span></p>

<p>“Our district is gradually and most manifestly improving
in all those great features of hygiene which are truly
essential where such masses of people congregate together.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for St. Martin-in-the-Fields,
who wrote in 1864 <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>“The spread of sanitary knowledge is <span class="no-break">slow”—</span></p>

<p>Wrote in <span class="no-break">1868:—</span></p>

<p>“Upon the whole, I am of opinion that all classes, even
the very poorest, are much more alive to their own interest
in supporting measures for the maintenance of health.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Mary, Newington,
wrote <span class="no-break">(1871):—</span></p>

<p>“The knowledge of a compulsory power, as well as the
spread of sanitary knowledge, and a greater appreciation of
it, has led to a vast amount of sanitary improvement.</p>

<p>“I can but express a strong conviction that the sanitary
measures carried out are working slowly but steadily a vast
improvement in both the morale and physique of the inhabitants
of this metropolis in particular … a great work is
progressing, the effects of which will be seen more and
more as years roll on, and will be recognised in the greater
comfort, better health, and augmented self-respect of the
people, and in an increased and increasing improvement in
the homes of those on whose strength or weakness must
depend in no slight degree the position for better or worse
of the English nation.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. George the Martyr,
in his report for 1870, makes a retrospect of fifteen <span class="no-break">years:—</span></p>

<p>“When the Vestries began (1856) their mighty task they
had to contend against evils and prejudices which had their
origin in far away back generations, and which have cast
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
down their roots deep and intricate into our social
system….</p>

<p>“The Acts under which the Vestries had to work were
very imperfect. Opposition was strong on every hand, the
magistrates sympathised with the defendants. Property
and its rights were apparently invaded; and property and
its rights have always claimed more support than property
and its duties.</p>

<p>“What was our physical condition? (in 1855).</p>

<p>“In every yard were one or more of ‘the foulest receptacles
in nature,’ namely, cesspools; these gave off,
unceasingly, foul effluvia, filling meat safe, cupboard,
passage and room. The smell met you on entering the
house, abode with you whilst you remained in it, and came
out with you on leaving it. The parish was burrowed with
them, and the soil soddened with the escape of their contents.
The emptying of them proved a true infliction.
They have now been emptied for the last time, filled up
with coarse disinfecting materials…. They would not
now be endured for a moment, yet with what difficulty
they were abolished. They were clung to as if some old
and honoured relic was about to be ruthlessly torn from its
possessors.”</p>

<p>Dr. Simon, the Medical Officer to the Privy Council,
gave, in his report of 1868,<a id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> a view of sanitary progress in
the country generally, much of which applied equally to
<span class="no-break">London:—</span></p>

<p>“It would, I think, be difficult to over-estimate, in one
most important point of view, the progress which, during
the last few years, has been made in sanitary legislation.
The principles now affirmed in our statute book are such as,
if carried into full effect, would soon reduce to quite an
insignificant amount our present very large proportions of
preventable disease. It is the almost completely expressed
intention of our law that all such states of property and all
such modes of personal action or inaction as may be of
danger to the public health, should be brought within scope
of summary procedure and prevention. Large powers have
been given to local authorities, and obligation expressly
imposed on them, as regards their respective districts, to
suppress all kinds of nuisance and to provide all such works
and establishments as the public health preliminarily
requires; while auxiliary powers have been given, for
more or less optional exercise, in matters deemed of less
than primary importance to health; as for baths and wash-houses,
common lodging-houses, labourers’ lodging-houses,
recreation grounds, disinfection-places, hospitals, dead-houses,
burial grounds, &amp;c. And in the interests of health
the State has not only, as above, limited the freedom of
persons and property in certain common respects: it has
also intervened in many special relations. It has interfered
between parent and child, not only imposing limitation on
industrial uses of children, but also to the extent of requiring
that children shall not be left unvaccinated. It has interfered
between employer and employed, to the extent of
insisting, in the interests of the latter, that certain sanitary
claims shall be fulfilled in all places of industrial occupation….</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>
<p>“The above survey might easily be extended by referring
to statutes which are only of partial or indirect or subordinate
interest to human health; but, such as it is, it
shows beyond question that the Legislature regards the
health of the people as an interest not less national than
personal, and has intended to guard it with all practicable
securities against trespasses, casualties, neglects and
frauds.</p>

<p>“If, however, we turn from contemplating the intentions
of the Legislature to consider the degree in which they are
realised, the contrast is curiously great. Not only have
permissive enactments remained for the most part unapplied
in places where their application has been desirable; not
only have various optional constructions and organisations
which would have conduced to physical well-being, and
which such enactments were designed to facilitate, remained
in an immense majority of cases unbegun; but even nuisances
which the law imperatively declares intolerable have, on an
enormous scale, been suffered to continue; while diseases
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
which mainly represent the inoperativeness of the nuisance-law,
have still been occasioning, I believe, fully a fourth part
of the entire mortality of the country. And when inquiry
is made into the meaning of this strange unprogressiveness
in reforms intended, and in great part commanded, by the
Legislature, the explanation is not far to seek. Its essence
is in the form, or perhaps I may rather say in the formlessness,
of the law. No doubt there are here and there other
faults. But the essential fault is that laws which ought to
be in the utmost possible degree, simple, coherent, and
intelligible, are often in nearly the utmost possible degree,
complex, disjointed and obscure. Authorities and persons
wishing to give them effect may often find almost insuperable
difficulties in their way; and authorities and persons with
contrary disposition can scarcely fail to find excuse or
impunity for any amount of malfeasance or evasion.”</p>

<p>To this review by one of the ablest and most experienced
of men of the time in matters relating to the public
health, it must, however, be added that so far as the
metropolis was concerned, “the meaning of this strange
unprogressiveness” was not so much the formlessness of
the law, as the fact that the interests against the enforcement
of many portions of the law were predominant, and
the non-administration of the law was due far more to that
circumstance than to any ambiguities or obscurities in the
laws. “Vested interests in filth and dirt” were all powerful
on the greater number of the local authorities of London,
and so the law which would have interfered with those
interests was left severely unadministered.</p>

<p>Against these interests it was difficult to struggle—especially
when there was no compulsion upon the
administrators of the laws to administer them. Sheltered
under a permissive, they would not exercise a compulsory
power—a power entrusted to them with the control of
public money for public good.</p>

<p>The true cause of the inoperativeness of the law was,
in a way, pointed out by the Medical Officer of Health for
St. James’, Westminster, when he wrote <span class="no-break">(1869–70):—</span></p>

<p>“The great deficiency of the Act of 1866, as of all other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
English legislation on sanitary matters, is that no public
prosecutor is appointed. If Vestries neglect to prosecute,
and individuals do not see their way to it, people may be
killed by infectious diseases to any extent.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for St. Giles’ expressed
a similar opinion when he wrote <span class="no-break">(1870):—</span></p>

<p>“The duty of making these sanitary improvements
should be imperative instead of permissive. It was wise,
at first, perhaps, that our sanitary legislation should be
tentative and experimental; but experience having proved
its necessity it should be made more stringent.”</p>

<p>But neither of them got so far as to see the natural and
simple remedy, that where a local authority for one reason
or another would not administer the laws made by Parliament,
the central authority should step in and do the work
at the cost and expense of the recalcitrant local authority.</p>

<p>If one set of people failed in their duty to the public,
it was but right that where such tremendous issues were
at stake as the health and physical well-being, not merely
of the people of one parish but of over three and a quarter
millions of people—and all that their health and well-being
implied—the administration of the law should be placed
in hands that would administer it.</p>

<p>That, however, was but part of the great problem,
though it would have gone a long way in ameliorating
things. The other necessity was the strengthening and
altering of the law which itself stood in need of many and
large changes before a sure foundation could be laid for the
future health of the great community resident in the great
metropolis of London.</p>

<p>And other matters which ultimately were to have great
influence towards the solution of some of the worst of the
health difficulties in London were coming into view, and
assuming form and substance.</p>

<p>Tramways, with their facilities of traffic, were about to
be started.</p>

<p>In 1869 three private Acts were passed, authorising
the construction and working of tramway lines in the
metropolis, and in the following year several more private
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Acts and “The Tramways Act, 1870,” which was a general
measure. Its main object was to provide a simple, inexpensive,
and uniform mode of proceeding in obtaining
authority for the construction of tramways, and to give the
local authorities the power of regulation and control.</p>

<p>In London the Metropolitan Board of Works was constituted
the “local authority” under the Act; and that
Board was empowered to apply for a Provisional Order
itself to construct tramways, and lease them to other
persons, and was given, with the approval of the Board
of Trade, a compulsory power of purchase after a period of
twenty-eight years on certain conditions.</p>

<p>And in 1870 another Act of the most far-reaching importance
was passed, “The Elementary Education Act,”
which prescribed the establishment of a School Board for
London, and which in process of time would exercise vast
influence towards a cleaner, brighter, healthier life than any
hitherto within the reach of the masses of the population of
London.</p>

<p>But though progress was being made in many ways, the
progress had not affected infantile life.</p>

<p>“The dreary catalogue of human misery” given in the
statistics of infantile mortality was as dreary as ever.</p>

<p>In every part of London those statistics were appalling.</p>

<p>In 1867, in the Whitecross Street District of St. Luke,
no less than 64·4 per cent. of the mortality for the district
consisted of deaths among children under five years of age.
In 1868 it was close upon 61 per cent.</p>

<p>In Bethnal Green, in 1869–70, of 3,378 deaths, 1,900 were
under five = 56·3 per cent.</p>

<p>In a sub-division of Whitechapel, in 1865–6, close upon
58 per cent. were under five; in Poplar a fraction short of
47 per cent.</p>

<p>In Kensington, in 1866, 40·6 per cent. were under five.</p>

<p>Each year the Medical Officer of Health for Fulham
drew attention to, and protested against, the high rate,
nearly 50 per cent., of infantile mortality under five, in
1867–8.</p>

<p>In Wandsworth, in 1870–1 = 47 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>In Camberwell, in 1868 = nearly 50 per cent.</p>

<p>In St. Mary, Newington, and in Rotherhithe = 50 per
cent.</p>

<p>In Bermondsey, in 1869–70 = 56 per cent.</p>

<p>In certain streets the percentage was much higher. Thus
in Paddington <span class="no-break">(1870–1):—</span><br /><br /></p>

<h2 class="chaptHead"><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">1871–1880</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">In</span> 1871, the decennial Census once more afforded reliable
information as to the population of London, and gave the
means of ascertaining much else of the greatest value.</p>

<p>The population had gone up to 3,254,260 in 1871, from
the 2,808,862 it had been in 1861, an increase of 445,398.
But the rate of increase was declining. The decennial increase
of population which had been 21·2 in 1841–1851,
18·7 in 1851–1861, had further declined to 16·1 in 1871.</p>

<p>The returns showed that London contained 2,055,576
persons born within its own limits, and 1,198,684 persons
born outside its borders.</p>

<p>“Whence came these multitudes of both sexes, equal in
themselves, without counting those born there, to a number
greater than the inhabitants of any other European city?”</p>

<p>More than 607,000 of them came from the chiefly agricultural
eastern, south-eastern, and south-midland counties
surrounding the metropolis.</p>

<p>A large contingent of 147,000 was drawn from Devonshire,
Wiltshire, Somersetshire, and the other south-western
counties.</p>

<p>The west-midland counties sent up 84,000.</p>

<p>41,000 persons had come from Scotland, 91,000 from
Ireland, 20,000 from the Colonies, and 66,000 from
foreign parts.</p>

<p>In fact, over 37 per cent. of the population of London in
1871 were immigrants into the great metropolis—a great
rushing river of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The returns were also of special interest in showing the
changes in the distribution of the population. Speaking
broadly, the previous movements were being continued—a
diminishing population in the central parts, an increasing
population in the outer parts.</p>

<p>It appeared to be inevitable <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“As the trade of London continued to increase, so the districts
which lay close to the great centres of business must
be expected to be occupied more and more with warehouses,
and less and less with the miserable dwelling-houses which
had hitherto sheltered its poor and working-class population.”</p>

<p>The diminution of the population of the central parts of
London was in no way a symptom of decay: it was, in
reality, proof of the reverse, being the result of increasing
trade, commerce, and wealth, which required more house
accommodation for the carrying on of their enormous
operations.</p>

<p>The great economic forces were in fact as active and
powerful as ever. In the City the population had fallen
in the decade from 111,784 to 74,635. In every one of the
six parishes or districts composing the Central group the
population had likewise decreased.</p>

<p>In the Eastern group, the population of three had decreased,
whilst in the others there were increases—notably
so in Poplar, where there was an increase of 37,000, and in
Bethnal Green, where there was an increase of 15,000.</p>

<p>In the Northern group all had increased, except St.
Marylebone—the increase in Hackney being over 41,000,
and in Islington over 58,000.</p>

<p>In the West, there were also large increases—Fulham
27,000, Paddington 21,000, Kensington 50,000. Only St.
James’ (Westminster) and Westminster had decreased, and
they in reality belonged more to the centre than to the west.</p>

<p>On the South side, with the exception of Christchurch,
St. Olave, and St. Saviour’s—all in Southwark—and Greenwich,
there was an increase in all the parishes or districts,
the increases in some being very large; 40,000 in Camberwell,
46,000 in Lambeth, 55,000 in Wandsworth.</p>

<p>The figures thus furnished by the Census enabled a fairly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
accurate calculation to be made as to the death-rate. It
now appeared to be 24·6 per 1,000 living.</p>

<p>The Registrar General, in his report for 1873, entered into
a comparison with previous years which may be assumed
to be as accurate as any such calculations could be.</p>

<p>The mortality was as high as 29·4 in 1854. It was 26·5
in 1866 (when cholera was epidemic), and it was as low as
21·5 in 1872, and 22·5 in 1873.</p>

<p>“The mortality never having been so low in any two consecutive
years since 1840, and by fair inference never so low
in any two years since London existed.”</p>

<p>This was distinctly encouraging, demonstrating as it did
the good results ensuing upon the great works of improved
drainage and sewerage, and a healthier water supply.</p>

<p>As to the housing of this huge population, it was shown
that the number of inhabited houses had increased from
360,035 to 419,642.</p>

<p>The reports of many of the Medical Officers of Health
throw much additional light upon, and explain or elucidate
the facts set out in the Census, and carry on the narrative
into later years of the matters recorded by the Census
Commissioners.</p>

<p>Thus, as regarded the reduction of the population in the
central group of parishes, the Medical Officer of Health for
the Strand District ascribed it in part to the new Law
Courts, and to the circumstance that residential houses
were, in increasing numbers, becoming converted into
business premises.</p>

<p>“But,” he added, “it is also probably in some measure
due to the greater facilities for locomotion to suburban
homes”; which is notable as almost, if not absolutely, the
first recognition of this cause affecting the population.</p>

<p>In St. James’, the decrease of population was “due to
the fact that the district had increasingly become the centre
for clubs, hotels, and splendid shops. The result had been
an enormous rise in the value of houses, and a gradual
extrusion of the less wealthy and important residents.”</p>

<p>In St. George-in-the-East, the Medical Officer of Health
stated <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“The decrease of population was due to houses being
taken by a railway company, by the Poor Law Guardians
for an infirmary, for a church, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>How considerable the clearances were in some districts
may be inferred from the figures given by the Medical
Officer of Health for St. Giles’ in 1871.</p>

<p>“The clearances in the City of London for the purposes
of erecting a new market, and a viaduct, and in the Strand
district to form a site for the proposed Law Courts, have
aggravated the evil of overcrowding. To effect these improvements
(or chiefly so) the large number of 18,358 persons
have been removed. Strand, 6,998; St. Sepulchre
(City), 4,188; St. Bride (City), 4,211; Saffron Hill, 2,961.”</p>

<p>And in St. Olave, on the south side of the river, the
Medical Officer of Health <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Since the census of 1861, 436 houses have been pulled
down, clearing away whole streets and courts for the formation
of railways and the extension of warehouses, displacing
961 families comprising 3,556 persons.”</p>

<p>Consequent upon these clearances, and the people having
to find dwelling room somewhere, the transition of houses
built for a single family into tenement-houses continued in
full swing.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Mary, Newington,
reported (1873) that year by year the better class of houses
were becoming less and less inhabited by a single family.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Paddington gave a
very clear description of the process.</p>

<p>“There is a very dense packing of population,” he wrote
(1873), and he mentioned some <span class="no-break">instances:—</span><br /><br /></p>

<p class="p1">“Builders intended these houses at first for one respectable
family, but … in violation of common sense and
decency they are let out in tenements and single rooms,
without those essential conditions of a dwelling which landlords
should in all instances be compelled to provide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is yet in reality no law to prevent the creation of
unhealthy districts as long as five or six families are allowed
to live in one house intended for a single family….
Houses should be built with reference to the future health
of the people who will have to live in them.</p>

<p>“And now, while the fields are open and still unbuilt
upon, it would be worth the attempt to overcome the
destructive influences likely to be established in building
tenement dwellings as the population gathers in this and
other neighbourhoods. They will some day be hives of
pauperism.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, in some parishes, the natural growth of the
population was very rapid. In Islington, for instance, the
Medical Officer of Health <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The Life Balance Sheet of your parish for 1875 shows
that your losses and gains leave you 4,376 lives to the good,
or in other words 4,656 deaths and 9,032 births have been
registered in the parish of St. Mary, Islington.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for St. Marylebone
wrote <span class="no-break">(1877):—</span></p>

<p>“If we compare the annual number of births with the
deaths, we shall find that every year some 1,200 or 1,500
more persons are born in the parish than die in it; and
what, it may be asked, becomes of the surplus population?
The only answer is, that it migrates; it could not remain
in the parish for the simple reason that there is no
room, all available spaces in St. Marylebone have long
been built upon, and the houses occupied, many of them
crowded.”</p>

<p>To the migration rendered necessary by the natural
growth of the population, and by the diminishing number
of houses in the central parts, was added the ceaseless
stream of fresh immigrants into London. These vast
numbers had to find house accommodation somewhere, and
they found it, in their tens of thousands, in various parts
of the less central portions of the metropolis.</p>

<p>In Kensington, for instance, the Medical Officer of Health
stated (1871) that the larger portion of the increase of
nearly 41,000 in the ten years was due to immigration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Fulham drew a graphic
picture of this inrush of humanity.</p>

<p>“The steady growth of London westward has thrown
among us a vast and teeming population of the working
classes, as well as those of more well-to-do condition, and
for the housing of the former many blocks of wretched
and most miserably constructed dwellings continue to be
erected with the most utter disregard for drainage or other
sanitary appliances now so essential. That part of Fulham,
once open fields, is still being rapidly covered with streets
and houses of this character, and many open spots in
Hammersmith are being filled in the same way. Our
healthy neighbourhood may thus be made ere long a land
of sickness and disease unless some check is given to
such speculative buildings. Our natural advantage with
all our care will not avail us against such utter recklessness.”</p>

<p>The increase of 21,000 in Paddington drew from the
Medical Officer of Health the <span class="no-break">query—</span></p>

<p>“… Whether any and what steps should be taken to
prevent the wholesale influx of a colossus of pauperism with
the consequent burdens of poverty and sickness.”</p>

<p>It had already driven the people underground for shelter,
for in 1871 he described <span class="no-break">how—</span></p>

<p>“Many of the underground kitchens in Leinster Street
(and four others named) have been inspected where the poor
people are found living like Esquimaux in underground cave
dwellings—places with impure air, want of light, admitted
only through a grating in front, the upper sash of the window
being often out of repair, or nailed up.”</p>

<p>The rapid increase of population in London would not
have been accompanied with such serious results to the
public health as it was, if the houses which were being so
rapidly built for the people to inhabit had been constructed
on sound sanitary principles.</p>

<p>But this was very far from being the case, and the evils
described in the last chapter in this respect continued over
an enlarged area, and in accentuated form.</p>

<p>It is now almost incredible that the laws should have been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
left in such a state as to enable builders, without any legal
check, to put up the houses they did.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Mile-End-Old-Town
pointed out (in 1872) that “The position and structure of
houses has a very distinct bearing upon the public health,
yet very little regard is given to sanitary principles in their
construction…. The class of small houses for the crowded
occupation of the poorer classes is generally built either
upon ‘made ground’ composed of refuse and débris of all
descriptions, the organic portion of which presently fills the
houses with various disease-producing gases, or upon newly
opened ground saturated with miasma, without the least
attempt at protection by means of previous drainage or
properly protected excavated foundations.”</p>

<p>And in 1876 he reverted to the <span class="no-break">subject:—</span></p>

<p>“Water, air, and light are nature’s disinfectants and preventions
of disease. They are abundantly provided, but
more meagrely and inefficiently used, and indeed practically
ignored, by architects, builders, owners, and occupiers….”</p>

<p>A witness before a Select Committee testified in 1874<a id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
<span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>“Houses were being built upon the soil—any soil, in
point of fact—and the foundations of houses consisted very
often of nothing but manure, and old boots, old hats, or
anything thrown into it.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Poplar wrote <span class="no-break">(1873):—</span></p>

<p>“The continued rapid increase in the number of new
streets and houses in various parts of the district presents
many unsatisfactory features.</p>

<p>“In most cases, before the buildings are commenced, the
gravel is dug out, and the hole filled up with so-called
brick rubbish, but in reality with road-sweepings, the
siftings of the dust yards and similar refuse. The dwelling-houses,
mostly of the poorer class, are largely built of soft
ill-burnt bricks, and are tenanted generally as soon as they
are finished—frequently even before they are complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“As a matter of course the walls are still damp, the streets
unpaved, and the residents suffer often very seriously in
their health.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health described ten acres of
houses in Hackney as “almost entirely built upon a
great dust heap,” built, too, of porous bricks and bad
mortar.</p>

<p>And another witness before a Select Committee in 1882
described how, in the other end of London—in Wandsworth—on
an estate “which practically might be considered a
small town,” the ground has been filled in to a depth of
six or seven feet with filth of every description, and houses
have been rapidly built upon it. The results to the health
of the inhabitants were disastrous.</p>

<p>This, however, by no means completed the description of
the evil condition of the buildings.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Shoreditch wrote
<span class="no-break">(1876–7):—</span></p>

<p>“Not only was the health of the inhabitants endangered
by the presence of a large number of old decayed brick drains,
but also by many new drains which had been carelessly laid.
Their joints leaked; in some places neither cement nor clay
had been used, and pipes had been connected with drains at
right angles.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for St. George-the-Martyr
added his testimony <span class="no-break">(1877–8):—</span></p>

<p>“Not only may the materials of which our buildings are
constructed be thus defective, but the drainage may be and
is indeed mostly laid carelessly and imperfectly…. An
eminent Civil Engineer, one who has had a very large
experience in this division of his profession, informs me that
90 per cent. of the houses built are imperfectly drained, that
the drains are laid in a reckless manner, the joints often not
cemented, and that the way in which they are laid is
unscientific and dangerous. No wonder we have continued
ill-health of the occupants.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Fulham described in
1872–3 how in “Fulham New Town” the basements of the
houses had been built below any available sewerage, with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the result of constant floodings of cesspool matter to the
great danger of the public health.</p>

<p>And the materials of which the superstructure was made
were as bad as they well could be. Porous, and half baked,
and broken bricks being used, and mortar mixed with
garden mould or road scrapings—“some without a particle
of lime in it.”</p>

<p>In Battersea <span class="no-break">Fields—</span></p>

<p>“You will find them there putting the houses together in
such a way that you may kick the walls down with your
feet.”<a id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel put the
subject very tersely when he wrote in <span class="no-break">1880:—</span></p>

<p>“In the construction of houses the only thing that appears
to be considered is that of cheapness.”</p>

<p>Until near the end of this decade of 1871–1881, a
building could be constructed without any supervision
of the materials, and any number of structures which
could not be occupied without danger to life or health
might be put up, for no one had power to interfere.
The London Building Act had no adequate clauses to
secure the effectual purity of new dwellings, nor had
the Sanitary Authority any power to check the practice
of building houses on rotten filth.</p>

<p>And so all these evil practices were very widely indulged
in; for though there were many respectable men among
builders of small houses, there were many who, regardless
of all consequences, covered the suburbs with “small,
rotten houses.” And immense numbers of the people
were absolutely unprotected either by the Government
or by the local authority from abuses which entailed upon
them ill-health and death, and from practices which
created and spread disease throughout the community.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. George-the-Martyr,
Southwark, referring to “the dishonest and
scandalous way” in which some houses were built, said
<span class="no-break">(1877–8):—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“From the greed of a few builders this traffic in
human life, and in what makes life valuable, is openly
and defiantly carried on. Under such circumstances full
health is impossible. Yet for the success and permanence
of natural existence a high standard is absolutely
necessary.”</p>

<p>Of builders such as these it may be truly said that
having created a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">damnosa hereditas</i> in one place, they
moved on to create fresh ones in others, and no one prevented
them.</p>

<p>So glaring were these evils that a Select Committee,
which sat in 1874 on the Metropolitan Buildings and
Management Bill of that year, <span class="no-break">recommended—</span></p>

<p>“That the District Surveyor or the Metropolitan Board
shall have full power to stop the progress of any building
in which the materials or construction is calculated to be
dangerous or injurious to health, and to summon the builder
or owner before the magistrate.”</p>

<p>At the rate houses were being built, the defective Building
Laws were a grave disaster.</p>

<p>In the two parishes of Bow and Bromley in Poplar, in
the five years ending March, 1878, notices were approved
for 1,981 new buildings.</p>

<p>In Hackney, in the year 1876–7, notices were given of
intention to erect 800 new houses, and the extension of
streets and houses into the fields had gone on so rapidly
that by that time there were but few fields left in the
district, or even large grounds belonging to any of the
houses.</p>

<p>In Kensington it was reported in 1875 that the increase
in the number of new houses brought into occupation had
for a considerable period averaged 700 annually.</p>

<p>In Wandsworth, in 1874–5, notices were received for 887
new houses.</p>

<p>And in every place land was being grabbed for building
purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel wrote
in <span class="no-break">1879:—</span></p>

<p>“We are now paying very dearly both in health and
money for the errors of preceding generations in their having
allowed houses to be packed closely together…. Several
cases have recently occurred in this district of landlords
erecting dwelling-houses in the back-yards of those houses
which were formerly occupied by a single family. This is a
serious evil and ought to be prevented. We have power
to prevent the overcrowding of rooms, and we certainly
ought to have power to prevent the cramming together of
houses on sites of insufficient size for the healthy existence
of the tenants.”</p>

<p>Even burial-grounds were not sacred, nor were public
authorities even immaculate in this respect. Thus in
<span class="no-break">St. Luke:—</span></p>

<p>“The Quakers’ burial-ground by the side of Coleman
Street is now (1876) in progress towards being covered with
buildings, and a portion was taken by the London School
Board for the erection of a school. In the process of
excavation for the foundation, human remains were
discovered.”</p>

<p>And the areas at the backs of houses were also being
rapidly covered over. The Act of 1855 had provided that
100 superficial feet should be left <span class="no-break">open—</span></p>

<p>“But the exigencies of trade have led the Metropolitan
Board of Works and the District Surveyors to permit the
area on the ground storey to be covered over.”<a id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>In fact, the insufficiency of the laws as regarded buildings
intended for human habitation, and the mal-administration
or non-administration of those laws which existed,
resulted in the creation of evils which inevitably and most
injuriously affected the health of the public, not merely at
the time, but for many years to come.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Giles’, in 1871,
pointed out the necessity of a change of the law.</p>

<p>“It is very much to be desired that the law gave more
stringent powers to local authorities to prevent the re-erection
of buildings upon the old sites, so that the new
buildings might not become as unfavourable to health as
the old ones…. Such a perpetuation of mischief ought
not to be permitted, and the rights of landlords should be
subordinated to the public good.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>
<p>The condition of existing, as apart from new, houses
also stood in need of many changes of the law to effect
their redemption. The necessity was forcibly portrayed
by the Medical Officer of Health for St. Marylebone
in 1870. He <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Of all the obstacles that stand in the way of anything
like effective sanitary operations, not only in St. Marylebone,
but in nearly every other district of the metropolis, there
are none so formidable, so apparently irremediable as the
miserable house accommodation provided for the labouring
classes. Year after year I am called upon to tell the same
unvarying story of rotten floors, broken walls and ceilings,
windows and roofs that let in the wind and the rain, chimneys
that will not let out the smoke, and of these wretched
tenements being crowded with honest, hard-working people,
from the cellars to the attics.”</p>

<p>Parliament continued in this decade the greater solicitude
about and interest in matters connected with the public
health, which it had recently been showing; and the first
year of the decade, 1871, is noteworthy for the adoption by
Parliament of a measure which had far-reaching effects upon
the sanitary evolution of the metropolis. This was the
creation (by “The Local Government Board Act, 1871”)
of a Central Government Authority for the supervision by
Government of the sanitary authorities in England and
Wales, and also of those in London.</p>

<p>Matters relating to the health of the people had become
so large a portion of the work of government, that the
necessity had forced itself upon Parliament of concentrating
in one department of the Government the supervision of
the laws relating to the public health, the relief of the poor,
and local government.</p>

<p>The new authority, which was entitled the Local Government
Board, was not a representative body, but was a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Government Department. It was to consist of a President,
appointed by the Queen, and of the following “ex-officio”
members—the Lord President of the Privy Council, all the
Secretaries of State for the time being, the Lord Privy Seal,
and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>All the powers of the Poor Law Board were transferred
to it, also certain powers and duties vested in Her Majesty’s
Privy Council. Several of the powers vested in or imposed
on a Secretary of State, relative to health matters, were also
transferred to it. Henceforth no bye-laws made by the
sanitary authorities in connection with their duties were
to be of any force until approved by the new Board.</p>

<p>Also the Board was to possess, in reserve for great
epidemic emergencies, a power to issue directions under
the Diseases Prevention Act, 1855.</p>

<p>But with the exception of such special cases, the function
of the new Central Authority in regard of local sanitary
action was primarily one of observation and inquiry.</p>

<p>The various Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis
being sanitary authorities thus came under the supervision,
and in some respects under the control, of the new Central
Government Board, instead of, as previously, under a branch
of the office of the Secretary of State for the Home Department;
but to all intents and purposes they retained their
liberty of administration, or, to state it more accurately,
their liberty of non-administration. Their relations to the
elected central body, the Metropolitan Board of Works,
remained unchanged.</p>

<p>In 1871, also, Parliament dealt with the water supply of
London. The essential importance to the health of the
population, especially in large towns, of an adequate supply
of wholesome water was becoming more generally recognised.</p>

<p>“Without water life cannot be sustained, cleanliness
cannot be maintained, sanitary measures are at a standstill,
drains become blocked, offensive and deleterious gases
are retained or driven back into the dwellings, disease is
caused and fostered, and public as well as private injury
caused in all directions.”</p>

<p>The Act of 1852 had failed to secure for the inhabitants
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the advantage which they ought to have long since enjoyed,
of a well-regulated supply of water in their houses for
domestic purposes.</p>

<p>A Select Committee of the House of Commons recommended
that every company should afford a constant supply
of water to each house,<a id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> so that the water might be drawn
direct and fresh from the company’s pipes at all times
during the twenty-four hours, and free from the pollution
so often acquired in dirty receptacles. And a Royal Commission,
appointed in 1867, after an elaborate inquiry,<a id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
declared that earnest and prompt efforts ought to be made
to introduce the constant service system to the furthest
extent possible in the metropolis. The Report of the
Royal Commission is memorable for the very strong expression
of opinion that the water supply of the metropolis
should be consolidated under public control.</p>

<p>The duty of supplying the inhabitants of a city with
water had from a very early period been regarded as a
peculiarly municipal function, and the supersession of the
municipalities by joint stock companies was a comparatively
modern innovation.</p>

<p>Thus far, however, Parliament was not disposed to go.
But (by the Metropolis Water Act, 1871) Parliament—contenting
itself mostly with “mights”—directed that
any company might propose to give a constant supply
of water, or the Metropolitan Board of Works might
apply to a company for it; failing both of which, and
under certain conditions, the Board of Trade might
require a constant supply to be provided. Also every
company <span class="no-break">should—</span></p>

<p>“On Sundays, as on other days, supply sufficient pure
and wholesome water for the domestic use of the inhabitants
within their limits.”</p>

<p>But the Act did not curtail the power of the companies to
cut off the supply to a house if the water-rate was not paid
by the landlord or owner. An opinion was expressed on
this point by the Medical Officer of Health for St. Mary,
Newington, in <span class="no-break">1872:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“I maintain that water is absolutely necessary for the
health, cleanliness, and sanitary condition of every one,
and that if a monopoly of its supply is granted to any
company, no power of withholding it should be allowed.</p>

<p>“In the present and increasing crowded condition of our
poorer houses the act of one person may enable a water
company to refuse it to a household of ten or twelve
people…. I do most strongly protest against a continuation
of a power which in its exercise undermines
the very foundation of sanitary improvement.”</p>

<p>Little, however, was done either by the Metropolitan
Board of Works, the Board of Trade, or the companies
to avail themselves of the optional provisions of the
Act.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for
Wandsworth, “there never was an Act of Parliament so
completely ignored in many districts as the one in
question.”</p>

<p>“The companies,” wrote another Medical Officer of
Health, “are too busy in looking after their trade
interests to concern themselves much about the health
of the people.”</p>

<p>And the constant supply to the people of London was
postponed to the distant future.</p>

<p>In 1871 another subject also claimed the attention of
Parliament.</p>

<p>An epidemic of smallpox of unexampled severity began at
the end of the year 1870, “the like of which had not been
known in England since vaccination was first practised.”
It increased in London at an alarming rate until it reached
its height in May, 1871, when 288 people died of it in one
week, and it killed in London alone, in that one year, 7,876
persons. And as it was reasonable to assume that one death
represented at the very least eight or ten times the number
of cases of that most loathsome disease, the results were
frightful, and the injury inflicted upon the community,
present and future, disastrous.</p>

<p>At one time more than 2,000 smallpox patients were
under the care of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the admissions into the Board’s hospitals about the same
time averaged 500 a week.</p>

<p>In a report on the subject the Committee of the House of
Commons <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“It is impossible to say what ravages might not have
been the result of the smallpox epidemic of 1870–1 had
it not been for the efficiency and energy of the Asylums
Board. Although the prophylactic virtues of vaccination
have been recognised on all sides, it must be remembered
that as yet but a small part of the growing population
has been subjected to the operations of the Compulsory
Vaccination Act.”</p>

<p>And they expressed “their strong sense of the great
services rendered to the metropolis by the managers.”</p>

<p>The prevention of smallpox by vaccination was not yet a
very potent factor in the diminution of that disease. Only
slowly could the Compulsory Vaccination Act of 1867 produce
effect, and as the appointment of public vaccinators
and the establishment of vaccination stations had been
made only optional, the mortality of the outbreak in 1870–1
had been but little, if at all, modified by it. The epidemic,
however, was used by some to enforce a lesson.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for St. James’
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The lesson of the great epidemic of smallpox is the
necessity for vaccination.</p>

<p>“The history of no other disease supplies so assuredly and
necessarily the means of its entire destruction.”</p>

<p>And the managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, in
a report issued in 1871, <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The necessity for re-vaccination when the protective
power of primary vaccination has to a great extent passed
away, cannot be too strongly urged. No greater argument
to prove the efficacy of this precaution can be adduced
than that out of upwards of 14,800 cases received into the
hospitals, only four well-authenticated cases were treated in
which re-vaccination had been properly performed, and these
were light attacks.”</p>

<p>Parliament passed an Act in 1871, making the appointment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of paid Vaccination Officers compulsory on all
Guardians, and the law generally more effective.</p>

<p>Likewise in 1871 Parliament dealt with another matter
affecting the public health, and placed on record its opinion
of the Vestries and District Boards by relieving them of the
duty of enforcing the sanitary provisions of the Workshops
Act, which they had failed to carry out, and transferring it
to Government Inspectors appointed by the Home Secretary.</p>

<p>This was quite an unprecedented amount of sanitary
legislation by Parliament in one year, and is very notable
as showing the greater position health matters were
assuming in the opinion of the nation, and the greater
necessity Parliament felt itself under for dealing with
them.</p>

<p>An improvement as regarded the food of the people of
the metropolis was also commenced about this time.</p>

<p>The Corporation of the City of London had undertaken
to carry out the provisions of Part III. of the Contagious
Diseases Animals Act, 1869,<a id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and had purchased the site of
Deptford Dockyard for the purpose of a cattle market, and
for the reception and slaughter of foreign cattle. The
market was opened in 1871, and the system of inspection
there inaugurated secured the good quality of a great portion
of the meat consumed in London.</p>

<p>In the following year (1872) the purity of certain articles
of the food and drink of the people engaged the attention of
Parliament.</p>

<p>Under the Act of 1860 the Vestries and District Boards
might each appoint an analyst, but the great majority of
them availed themselves of the permissive character of the
Act, and did not appoint one.</p>

<p>A sidelight is thrown upon the effect of this inaction of
the local authorities by evidence given in 1862 by a master
baker named W. Purvis. He <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“When the Act passed for preventing the adulteration of
articles of food and drink there was an immediate apprehension
among those bakers in the trade who adulterate their
bread that they would be liable to have their bread frequently
analysed, &amp;c. But when it was found that no
sufficient means were provided by the Act to meet the
expenses of this kind of active and constant supervision
(the purchaser having to pay the analyst), they became
confident again, and have resumed their practice of
adulteration without any fear of detection.”<a id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>It was felt now that some further move should be made,
and Parliament added another Act for preventing the
adulteration of food, drink, and drugs to the long list of
those which had gone before.</p>

<p>“Whereas the practice of adulterating articles of food and
drink and drugs for sale in fraud of Her Majesty’s subjects,
and to the great hurt of their health and danger to their
lives, requires to be repressed by more effectual laws than
those which are now in force for that <span class="no-break">purpose—</span></p>

<p>“Be it <span class="no-break">enacted——”</span><a id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>This Act made it incumbent upon all Vestries and District
Boards to appoint public analysts to analyse all articles of
food, drink, and drugs, on the request of any parishioners,
on payment of a fee; and imposed the duty upon them of
procuring and submitting for analysis articles suspected to
be adulterated, and on their being certified to be so, of
taking proceedings before a magistrate, who was given
power to impose severe penalties. The offences were more
clearly defined, and the expense of executing the Act was
to be paid out of the rates.</p>

<p>The Act did much good, but the amount of good was not
to be judged by the number of prosecutions and convictions.
“Its deterrent effects were undoubtedly great.”<a id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>A Select Committee of the House of Commons, which had
been appointed in 1872 to inquire into the subject, recommended
the repeal of previous Acts dealing with the subject,
and the enactment of a new and more compulsory measure,
and in concluding their report they said: “Your Committee
believe it will afford some consolation to the public to know
that in the matter of adulteration they are cheated rather
than poisoned. Witnesses of the highest standing concur
in stating that in the numerous articles of food and drink
which they have analysed, they have found scarcely anything
injurious to health.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1875 a further Act dealing with this matter was passed
amending and strengthening the existing law.</p>

<p>In September, 1872, another notable step in the sanitary
evolution of London was taken in the creation of an
authority for the protection of the metropolis against the
importation of disease by sea from foreign countries or
from home ports.</p>

<p>“It is now acknowledged,” wrote the Port Medical Officer
of Health in his first report, “that, as a natural result of the
insular position of the kingdom, and the vast extent of our
commerce, the sanitary condition of shipping and of the
floating population must exercise a considerable influence
on the health of the country as regards the importation
and transmission of epidemic diseases … the urgent
advisability of using all means to prevent the introduction
of disease into this the largest port in the world is
sufficiently apparent.”</p>

<p>Hitherto the prevention of the importation of the various
sorts of disease into London by vessels trading to the Port
of London from all quarters of the world had been confided
to the officers of Her Majesty’s Customs, and was of the most
superficial and inadequate character.</p>

<p>The district assigned to the Port of London Sanitary
Authority extended from Teddington Lock to the North
Foreland, and was 88 miles in length. It included 8 sets
of docks and 13 “creeks.”</p>

<p>In the section of river lying between London Bridge and
Woolwich Arsenal Pier, about 10 miles in length, there was
a constant average of no less than 400 vessels of all descriptions
moored on both sides of the river, more than 90 per
cent. of which had crews on board.</p>

<p>The creeks were more or less occupied by barges containing
manure, street-sweepings, gas-liquor, bones and
other varieties of foul cargoes, inasmuch as depôts for the
storage of these materials existed on the banks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>And lying in the docks there was an average of between
six to seven hundred vessels, over none of which had the
sanitary authorities on the sides of the river any control
whatever.</p>

<p>This was a most unsatisfactory condition of things, and
left London open to the practically unchecked importation
of infectious and contagious disease of every kind.</p>

<p>By “Provisional Order” of the Local Government
Board, the Corporation of London was constituted the
Sanitary Authority of the Port of London,<a id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and was made
responsible not only for taking proper steps, under Orders
in Council, to prevent the introduction of cholera, but was
required also to carry out, within its allotted area, the
provisions of the various Nuisances Removal Acts and
Prevention of Diseases Acts for England, and the Sanitary
Act of 1866.</p>

<p>Its authority extended only to things afloat. Whatever
was landed came within the province of the local Sanitary
Authority, except things landed in the docks, and things
“in bond,” which were under the control of Her Majesty’s
Customs.</p>

<p>The work was undertaken at considerable expense by the
Corporation out of the City’s cash, and at no charge to the
ratepayer.</p>

<p>And a Medical Officer of Health for the Port and some
Inspectors were appointed.</p>

<p>It was the duty of the Port Medical <span class="no-break">Officer—</span></p>

<p>“To inspect, before landing, all emigrants that arrived in
the Port from the Continent for purposes of transhipment,
and to isolate all suspected cases, and to carry out all
Special Orders in Council relating to the prevention of
cholera, or other epidemic diseases.”</p>

<p>He was also charged with the duty of inspecting, at
Gravesend, any cases of sickness on inward-bound vessels
reported to the authorities by the officers of Her Majesty’s
Customs.</p>

<p>As to the prevention of the importation of epidemic
diseases other than cholera, reliance was placed upon a
speedy and proper examination of vessels as soon as possible
after they had come to moorings. A large proportion of
these vessels required constant general inspection.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>
<p>Among the various other duties, fumigation and disinfection
of vessels, also of clothing, were not the least
important.</p>

<p>For isolation of the sick a hospital ship was maintained
at Gravesend.</p>

<p>The work done by the Port Authority was, in spite of
many limitations and difficulties, considerable; and the
inspection of thousands of ships, the cleansing and fumigation
of foul or infected vessels, the removal to hospital of
seamen suffering from infectious or contagious disease, and
the disinfection of clothing were, sanitarily, of the greatest
advantage to the inhabitants of the metropolis.</p>

<p>In another matter Parliament, in 1872, made a completely
new departure.</p>

<p>It declared that “it was expedient to make better provision
for the protection of infants entrusted to persons to
be nursed or maintained for hire or reward in that behalf.”
And it inaugurated a plan for the protection of the health
of the most helpless of its numerous charges—a plan
embodied in the Infant Life Protection Act.</p>

<p>“Houses of persons retaining or receiving for hire two
or more infants for the purpose of nursing must be
registered.”</p>

<p>The Local Authority (the Metropolitan Board of Works)
was to cause a register to be kept and make bye-laws, and
might refuse to register an unsuitable house.</p>

<p>And the registered owner must keep a register of the
children, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>If proved to the satisfaction of the local authority that
such person has been guilty of serious neglect, or is
incapable of providing the infants with proper food and
attention, the house might be struck off the Register, and
penalties be imposed—six months with hard labour, and
up to £5 fine.</p>

<p>The start made was slow, only six houses having been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
registered in 1876; but the Act laid the foundations of a
scheme which has had considerable developments.</p>

<p>Specially valuable is it to have the views of one of the
foremost men of his time upon the phase of opinion
existing at this period upon the general question of the
public health. They help to mark progress along the
road. The late Mr. W. E. Forster, speaking at the meeting
of the British Association at Bradford in 1873, <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“I think our aims in this direction are higher than they
used to be. We are aiming not only at preventing death,
but at making life better worth living by making it healthy.
And we no longer forget that in fighting our battle against
disease it is not only those who are killed that are merely
to be considered, but also the wounded. In those terrible
inflictions of preventable disease throughout the country
the loss of life is very sad; but even more sorrowful to
my mind are the numbers of our fellow-creatures—fellow-countrymen
and women—who are doomed to struggle
and fight the battle of life under the most severe
conditions because of wounds they have received from
preventable diseases.”</p>

<p>While Parliament was thus legislating on several matters
considerably influencing the sanitary well-being of the
people of the metropolis, the powerful economic and social
forces also affecting it were silently and uninterruptedly
continuing their work with never-ceasing energy.</p>

<p>With the marvellous industrial developments of the time,
trade, and commerce, and businesses of various kinds and
sorts were spreading over a wider area, and constantly
claiming accommodation to carry them on; and the process
continued of the conversion of residential houses into offices
and shops and warehouses and workplaces.</p>

<p>The increase of houses in other parts of London, rapid as
it was, barely kept pace with the increase of population,
whilst it had practically done nothing as yet to relieve
overcrowding in the central parts of London.</p>

<p>The excessive density of the population was a great
sanitary evil.</p>

<p>“It is a well established law,” wrote the Registrar
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
General in 1872, “that, other things being equal, the
insalubrity of a place increases with the density of the
population, and that the fevers generated in crowded
dwellings have a tendency to spread among the whole of
the population.”</p>

<p>And it was already pretty generally recognised by
Medical Officers of Health that the chief condition affecting
the mortality of a locality was the density of population.</p>

<p>The Medical Officers of Health never ceased pointing
out the evils of overcrowding.</p>

<p>“Overcrowding,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for
Whitechapel in 1877, “concerns the whole community, as
is strikingly shown by the spread of many diseases which
are, perhaps, in the first instance endemic, and confined to
these overcrowded places, but which soon become epidemic
and extend over large areas, attacking, indiscriminately,
all classes.”</p>

<p>And their reports are full of instances which had come
under their observation.</p>

<p>Thus, in 1871, the Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“At No. 13, Goulston Street, I found in the back
room of the ground floor, closely contiguous to three
closets and a dust hole, one man, six women, and three
children sleeping there. The room measured 12 × 9 × 7 feet,
giving only a cubic space of 756 feet for ten persons.”</p>

<p>He mentioned also “a room in Cooper’s Court, occupied
by man, wife, and seven children, which contained about
630 cubic feet of space, which allows only 70 feet for
each.”</p>

<p>And numerous other cases of overcrowding and indecent
occupation, and a case in which the dead body of a child had
been retained in a room for fifteen days.</p>

<p>Passing on to the larger aspects of this dreadful
overcrowding, he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“It is manifest that persons living in such circumstances
must become so enfeebled in health as to be unfit for any
employment which requires much physical strength. The
mental capacity of such persons is also so low as to prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
them earning a livelihood in any occupation requiring much
thought, and the consequence is an increase of paupers or
of criminals, or perhaps of both.”</p>

<p>“Consumption and the whole tubercular class of disease
are chiefly caused by the defective ventilation of dwelling-houses,
and particularly of sleeping rooms, in which at
least one-third of one’s existence is passed.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Paddington, in his
report for 1871, <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Serious evils of physical and moral character are found
to afflict the population of these overcrowded houses. The
want of fresh air, habitual uncleanliness, bad washing
accommodation, with other unsanitary conditions, favour
the spread of contagion. There is a notable increase of
tubercular and consumptive maladies in our large cities, and
the low form of vitality engendered in people who do not
enjoy fresh air, leads to the abuse of stimulants and
tobacco.”</p>

<p>In 1874 he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“… Eighteen per cent. of the whole deaths—a formidable
proportion—are from the tubercular class of diseases:
a greater proportion than zymotic. The 206 deaths from
consumption at ages between 20 and 60 show that
there exists some general cause silently working great
mischief and undermining the constitution of parents
at a period of life in health and strength when they can
least be spared from their families.”</p>

<p>And he <span class="no-break">added:—</span></p>

<p>“Large numbers of sickly and weakly children abound
in the tenement-houses of our thickly populated streets.”</p>

<p>Nor were the homes of the people the only place where
overcrowding worked its evil will. Many children—how
many there is no means of knowing—suffered from it in
the schools which they attended.</p>

<p>The following extracts from reports of an Inspector
of the School Board<a id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> present a vivid picture of the condition
of many schools in existence so late as the year
1874.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<p>1. —— <em>School</em>.</p>

<p>“This is a wretched place, a disgrace to the metropolis.
The ‘school’ is held in an old dwelling-house in Clerkenwell.
The house was at one time used as a stable. The
approach is most unwelcome, and on entering the schoolroom
(upstairs) a most deplorable picture presented itself
to the eye. Fifty children crowded together in a small,
dingy, shapeless room with space for sixteen, and the
window and door carefully closed—in fact, the latter and
the doors downstairs carefully bolted. The sooner this
place is closed the better.”</p>

<p>2. —— <em>School</em>.</p>

<p>“As regards the accommodation provided, thirty-six
young children were sitting in an upper room into which
the rays of the sun on a bright day in June could not enter—twilight
in mid-day.”</p>

<p>3. —— <em>School</em>.</p>

<p>“It would be impossible for words to describe the inefficient
state of this so-called school. Eighty-two children
of different ages—boys and girls—huddled together in a
miserable, badly lighted, badly ventilated room, affording
accommodation for twenty-three at the utmost.</p>

<p>“No books, no apparatus, no seats; floor and bare walls:
the ‘teacher’ an aged man, standing in the midst of a
crowd of children and wielding a cane to keep the
‘scholars’ quiet, and thus the time goes on.”</p>

<p>4. —— <em>School</em>.</p>

<p>“This is not a school—it seems a baby-farm. Seventeen
children in a small, filthy hovel. There were four infants
a few months old; one lay on a small bed, another in a
small cot, and the two others in positions which I cannot
here describe. The little ones were quite naked. The
woman who pretends to look after this ‘school’ was
engaged in a back yard washing. From the woman
down to the infant, all here seemed steeped in ignorance
and wretchedness.”</p>

<p>Here is a case reported by the Medical Officer of Health
for Whitechapel, so late as <span class="no-break">1880:—</span></p>

<p>“A schoolroom at 11, Pelham Street, Spitalfields; 9 feet
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
long × 8 × 8. There were twenty-five children aged
4–7, and the master and his wife, in all twenty-seven
persons, giving 21·3 cubic feet for each.”</p>

<p>And here is a report of an early crêche, or baby farm,
also in Whitechapel, in <span class="no-break">1879:—</span></p>

<p>“The Sanitary Inspector found on the ground floor of
24, Freeman Street, Spitalfields, a woman and twenty-five
children all under three. They were left in charge of the
occupier of the room from nine until 5.30 p.m., who was
paid 3d. per week per child. The room was 15 feet × 7 × 7,
thus affording 28 cubic feet of space per child!! The room
was badly ventilated, there were neither chairs nor seats,
the children were on the floor, which was in a wet and
dirty condition.”</p>

<p>The other causes of insanitation were also flourishing.
“Noxious businesses” of various kinds continued to
pollute the atmosphere, despite legislation against them,
and the existence of local authorities charged with the
administration of that legislation—a permanent pollution all
the year round, and from which there was no getting away.</p>

<p>Very commonly the arches under the railways were used
for making and storing artificial manures, the smell from
which was intolerable.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Mary, Newington,
<span class="no-break">1871:—</span></p>

<p>“The private manure-mixing yards have ever been the
cause of much annoyance and illness to those living in
the neighbourhood. One of these,” he added, “had for
years been complained of.”</p>

<p>And yet the Vestry had not shut it up. And the air
was tainted and vitiated by the emanations from them, the
owners having no vestige of regard for other people’s health.</p>

<p>Another cause of insanitation was the existence of
slaughter-houses throughout London, in the most crowded
parts, and in close propinquity to dwelling-houses; indeed,
in the yards of some of them were slaughter-houses, with all
their unpleasant concomitants. Cow-houses, too, also
close to houses, were numerous, and, in the outer parts of
London, even piggeries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>A great opportunity was lost in 1874 for greatly
diminishing, if not actually terminating, the great
“nuisance” of slaughter-houses.</p>

<p>By an Act passed in 1844, it was declared absolutely
illegal, on the expiration of thirty years after the passing
of the Act, to carry on certain noxious businesses in any
premises nearer a dwelling-house than 50 feet, or nearer
a public way than 40 feet—the business of slaughtering
being among the number. Until 1851 there was no
control over slaughter-houses; any one could conduct a
slaughter-house who pleased, subject only to the common
law as to doing anything which might be considered a
nuisance.<a id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The Metropolitan Market Act, passed in that year,
required that all slaughter-houses should be licensed by
the justices, thus establishing some form of control over
them.</p>

<p>When, in 1874, the expiration of the thirty years drew
nigh, doubts were raised by those interested in their continuance
as to the interpretation of the Act of 1844. The
Select Committee, which was investigating the subject of
“Noxious Businesses,” stated that no evidence had been
given before it to show that any of these trades when
properly conducted affect the health of the persons living
near the premises, and Parliament, accepting this view,
passed an Act which undid the enactment of 1844, and
allowed slaughter-houses to be continued indefinitely under
license. At the same time it conferred on the central
authority, the Metropolitan Board of Works, power to
make bye-laws with respect to certain noxious trades.</p>

<p>And so this fertile cause of insanitation—slaughter-houses—was
perpetuated to the present time.</p>

<p>There was, however, a far more general and potent cause
of disease and death, and general detriment to the public
health, than the pollution of the atmosphere by noxious
trades, and that was the reckless scattering abroad of
infectious or contagious diseases by persons afflicted with
or in contact with such diseases.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>
<p>The Metropolitan Asylums Board had already erected
hospitals, and were doing a vast amount of good and preventing
the spread of disease.</p>

<p>But by the people themselves the seeds of infection
were scattered broadcast.</p>

<p>Dr. Simon, the Medical Officer to the Privy Council,
in his Report of 1865, <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“As to contagions already current in the country,
practically any diseased person scatters his infection broadcast,
almost where he will—typhus or scarlatina, typhoid
or smallpox, or diphtheria, … the present unlimited
license seems urgently to demand restriction.”</p>

<p>But the license to kill remained without restriction,
except that of entering a public conveyance.<a id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>As the Medical Officer of Health for St. Mary, Newington,
wrote in <span class="no-break">1871:—</span></p>

<p>“How many are the ways in which the spread of
contagious disease is, as it were, invited, no one knows
better than a sanitary officer. Washing, mangling, needlework,
go on in many an infected house; children, aye
adults also, the sick and the sound, mix indiscriminately.
I have even known the exhibition, as a sight, of the corpse
of a smallpox patient….”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Paddington called
attention (1873–4) <span class="no-break">to—</span></p>

<p>“The extreme indifference displayed with regard to
these diseases (measles, &amp;c.), by many of the lower and
middle class is an unmistakable sign of an ignorant
belief that they are natural events; and such a belief
leads to a carelessness of management much to be
condemned.</p>

<p>“… The working classes generally visit freely during
sickness, allowing their clothes to become saturated with
contagious poison.”</p>

<p>The Vestries and District Boards did do a certain amount
of disinfection; but more than three years after the
Sanitary Act of 1866 was passed, in twenty-nine districts
(out of thirty-eight) no proper disinfecting establishment
in accordance with the requirements of the law had been
provided (Strand, 1869–70).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>
<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. James’, Westminster,
pointed out (1870–1) that in London there <span class="no-break">was—</span></p>

<p>“No legal obligation on the part of the head of a family
or landlord, or a medical man, to declare the presence of
scarlet fever to the sanitary authority. The consequence
is, that long before any knowledge of the existence of the
disease has been obtained by the Medical Officer of Health
the disease has spread far and wide. If it were not so
melancholy, one feels inclined to deride the folly and
ignorance of a so-called civilised and enlightened nation
allowing such a cruel and terrible scourge as this to pass
over the country without any attempt to control it.”</p>

<p>“In sixteen years we have lost 479 persons by scarlet
fever in St. James’. Where one person dies, 10–20 get
it and get well. It is vain to calculate the pecuniary
expense of such a curse, but every one can make something
like an approximation to the cost of such a waste of human
life, and form an opinion of the vast benefit of legislation
that should put a stop to this disease.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Paddington referred
(1876) to the disastrous results of cases of infectious illness
not being notified to the sanitary authority, and so enabling
precautions being taken to stamp out the infection.</p>

<p>“Such a state of matters, with the annual huge mortality
consequent thereon, will continue until an educated people,
conscious of its duties and jealous of its rights, demands
from a tardy executive the intervention of the legislature
to prevent it.”</p>

<p>The Vestries and District Boards were gradually doing
a good deal of useful work of the sort which did not much
conflict with private interests. The great main drainage
works of the Central Authority had enabled them to improve
and extend their sewerage and drainage works, and from
1856 up to March, 1872, they had borrowed from the
Metropolitan Board of Works £757,000 for this purpose;<a id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
and the total length of brick and pipe sewer
which they constructed in that period was very close
upon 700 miles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>
<p>“The large amount which has been expended on works
of sewerage and paving, shows that the local authorities
in the metropolis have not been unmindful of the requirements
of their several districts.”</p>

<p>St. Giles’ reported in 1872 that its sewerage was very
complete, “not a single street or court being without a sewer.”</p>

<p>St. Marylebone reported in <span class="no-break">1877:—</span></p>

<p>“£33,500 has been spent in new sewers in the parish
in the last three years, and £7,000 is to be spent. Over
three miles of new sewers were constructed. These are
large items in our parochial expenditure, but the fact
cannot be ignored that the sewerage of the parish had
got into a disgraceful and indeed dangerous condition.</p>

<p>“In some of the finest streets and squares of the
parish the sewers were but little better than elongated
cesspools.”</p>

<p>Bermondsey reported, in 1872, that the entire district
was drained into low level sewers, all open sewers, tidal
and other ditches, and cesspools having been abolished;
£5,200 expended in widening and improving certain
streets, £92,000 spent in sewerage, paving, and other
improvements.</p>

<p>St. Mary, Newington, reported in 1871 that the whole
of the open sewers and tidal ditches had been covered
over; that the drainage was in a satisfactory condition,
and that within a few pounds of £400,000 had been spent
since 1856 in various parish works and maintenance.</p>

<p>In the Wandsworth district <span class="no-break">(1873–4):—</span></p>

<p>“The enormous sanitary works carried on by the Metropolitan
Board of Works and the Board of the District
have, by drying the soil and altering the waterlogged
condition which formerly prevailed, completely changed
the sanitary aspect of the locality.”</p>

<p>Not all the work reported as done, however, was done
as satisfactorily as was to be desired.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for St. James’,
Westminster, wrote <span class="no-break">(1871–2):—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sewers and drains being out of sight admit of a great
amount of ‘scamping’ work.</p>

<p>“Speaking from experience, some of the local sewers in
St. James’ are specimens, I hope unique, of the extent
to which ‘scamping’ can be carried.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Shoreditch wrote
(1878) <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>“Some of the new drains (being so badly laid) are more
dangerous than the old.”</p>

<p>The arrangements for water supply were also in
some few parishes, in process of years, being slowly
improved.</p>

<p>In Lambeth, in 1872, 646 houses without proper water
supply were provided with it; and in 1873, 804 houses.</p>

<p>Read one way, this was satisfactory. Read the other,
it was a revelation of the number of houses in Lambeth
which had been left until 1873 without that great essential
of health—a “proper water supply.”</p>

<p>A large amount of street paving had been done,
and a few small street improvements had been carried
out.</p>

<p>Considering the very limited staff of Inspectors which
it suited the policy and purposes of the Vestries to
appoint, a fair amount of sanitary inspection was done
in some parishes and districts.</p>

<p>The striking fact about the inspections made is the
very high proportion of houses in which the sanitation
was defective.</p>

<p>In Bermondsey, in 1879, where 1,577 houses and premises
were inspected, 1,495 notices were served.</p>

<p>In Limehouse, in 1879, 1,411 houses were inspected; and
1,070 orders for sanitary amendments issued.</p>

<p>In Shoreditch, where there were 15,500 houses, the two
Sanitary Inspectors appear to have done a lot of useful
sanitary work. In 1877–8, 5,465 separate nuisances
dangerous to health were abated.</p>

<p>If anything like a similar proportion prevailed generally
throughout London, the housing of its huge population
was indeed in a dreadful state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>In some ways the local authorities were awakening to
their responsibilities, and beginning to avail themselves
of some of the provisions placed by Parliament at their
disposal.</p>

<p>In Paddington, St. Giles’, and Rotherhithe, the Vestries
had adopted the Baths and Washhouses Act of 1846, and
thus helped to promote habits of cleanliness, and to diminish
some of the insanitary evils consequent on the tenements
being turned into temporary wash-rooms.</p>

<p>And in St. James’ (Westminster) and Lambeth, mortuaries
had been provided, which, in some cases, at any rate,
obviated some of the insanitary evils consequent on the
retention of dead bodies for long periods in single-roomed
tenements where death had been caused by contagious or
infectious diseases.</p>

<p>More action was being taken, too, as regards the disinfection
of rooms where there had been cases of infectious
disease. Thus in Lambeth in 1877–8, 824 houses were
disinfected.</p>

<p>Here and there, too, the owners of noxious trades
were being compelled to adopt methods rendering their
businesses less insanitary and objectionable to their neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>The Local Government Board had caused an elaborate
inquiry to be made by Dr. Ballard as <span class="no-break">to—</span></p>

<p>“‘In what measure and by what means nuisances and
injury to health from offensive businesses might be
avoided,’ and the report led to quite a satisfactory
result.</p>

<p>“It showed that by the application of such knowledge
as was at command, all or nearly all businesses that are
in a serious degree offensive might be carried on either
without offence, or with such important reduction of
offence, as should make it tolerable, or even trivial.”<a id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>In Fulham several piggeries were closed by law; not
without regret, apparently, for the Medical Officer of
Health stated in his <span class="no-break">report:—</span></p>

<p>“It certainly is very hard on the pig keepers individually,
but it is in accordance with the recognised law of civilisation,
that the interests of the few must be sacrificed to
the welfare of the many.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>
<p>Upon one course of action all the Medical Officers of
Health were in agreement—the absolute necessity of
inspection and supervision of the houses of the people.
In season and out of season they advised it, and urged
it as the most essential and the most useful of all duties.</p>

<p>In support of these views they could point to the
results of inspection and supervision in the registered
Common Lodging Houses.</p>

<p>In the parish of Spitalfields (in Whitechapel, 1880)
there were 109 of these houses containing 454 rooms
registered to accommodate 3,992 lodgers. The class
of persons occupying them were, notoriously, the very
lowest.</p>

<p>“We failed to learn that any respectable mechanic
with his wife and family ever applied at these houses
for lodging accommodation. Yet,” reported the Sanitary
Inspector (1880), “we discovered no case of overcrowding.
The bedding was clean; the yards and closets were in a
good sanitary condition; there was a good water supply,
and the walls and ceilings of the houses were clean.”</p>

<p>If these results were obtainable in dealing with the
worst classes, in the overcrowded parts of Whitechapel,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i>, inspection and supervision would have been
productive of similar benefits among the general tenement
population.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. George-in-the-East
referred to the low mortality in model lodging-houses,
where also there was supervision.</p>

<p>“There we find good sound dwellings, &amp;c., &amp;c. No
overcrowding is permitted, only a certain number in
family being accepted as tenants. Cleanliness on their
part is expected—enforced if necessary—or a notice to quit
is speedily given.”</p>

<p>While thus recommending inspection, supervision, and
compulsory rules, another view was also expressed.<a id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>
<p>“As laws have been enacted for the abatement of
overcrowding, it is easy to say: ‘let those in authority
put them in force’; but I much fear unless the question
is taken up with a spirit of love towards the poorer and
more ignorant classes by the upper and middle classes,
and measures adopted to give instruction to the poor in
matters concerning their physical well-being, the existing
state of things will long continue.”</p>

<p>“No class will become civilised by being left to themselves,
as unfortunately is the case in the numerous back
slums of London, but improvement, physically and
socially, can only be effected by a superior class mixing
and associating with a class below them.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Poplar <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The poor want more than model dwellings, more
than warmth, food and clothing; they want humanity,
and the knowledge of the laws governing health.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately those remedies were, at best, a matter
of considerable time, and improvement could be but of
slow growth. Immediate measures were required to cope
with the appalling evils, and for the house-owners, even
more than for the unfortunate tenants, were supervision
and compulsory rules requisite.</p>

<p>But not one tithe of the Vestries and District Boards
would enforce against owners the regulations under the
35th Section of the Sanitary Act of 1866.</p>

<p>Though something was being done as regarded the
inspection of houses and the repair of sanitary defects,
hardly any progress could be said to have been made
for the improvement of the dwellings of the poor.</p>

<p>The Artizans’ and Labourers’ Dwellings Act (Torrens)
of 1868 was to a small extent being made use of.</p>

<p>In some parishes houses considered by the Vestry or
District Board as unfit for human habitation had been
closed, and were only allowed to be reopened upon proper
repairs having been carried out. In other cases where
no amount of repairs could put the house into habitable
condition, the landlord was directed to pull down the
buildings (without his receiving any compensation), and,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
in default, the Vestry could pull it down at his expense.
The site remained unoccupied, until the owner or landlord
used it again for building purposes, or sold it to some
one else.</p>

<p>In St. Giles’ (1873–4) the District Board has been enabled
under the Act to enforce “considerable improvements
in and immediately adjoining the worst parts of
St. Giles’.” (Houses in yards and courts were demolished.)</p>

<p>In St. Luke the total number of houses “pulled down
or closed” amounted by the year 1875 to 104.<a id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>In Holborn the Board had <span class="no-break">been—</span></p>

<p>“Applying or threatening to apply the Act to houses
that could be fairly subjected to it. Besides having 150
houses, chiefly belonging to one owner, put into a complete
sanitary repair, it has been actually applied to 136 houses;
70 thoroughly repaired, 40 demolished, 26 to be rebuilt,
and 10 to be closed.”</p>

<p>There were many difficulties in using the Act. Notice of
houses being unfit had to be given to “owners.” A certain
case in Chelsea was mentioned <span class="no-break">where—</span></p>

<p>“There were freeholders, lessees, under-lessees, and sub-lessees,
and their trustees and mortgagees, and besides there
were the occupiers.”</p>

<p>But in the great majority of parishes or districts no steps
were taken under the Act. The Act did not give any compensation
to the owners of condemned property, as Parliament
had declared by it that compensation should not be
given to those who permitted their property to fall into
such a state, whilst at the same time extracting the
fullest benefit from it.</p>

<p>To such a doctrine there was, of course, the strongest
hostility by all those who held the opinion that a man
might do as he liked with his own, and extract from it
the uttermost farthing regardless of the infliction of disease
and suffering and death upon those who were so unfortunate
as to become his tenants, and reckless as to the injury
his action was inflicting upon the community at large.
And <span class="no-break">so:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“The reluctance of the local authorities to take away a
man’s property was insuperable, and consequently no very
great demolition took place.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Pancras wrote
<span class="no-break">(1876):—</span></p>

<p>“The Act is almost inoperative. The highly penal nature
of this statute, which in the event of demolition gives no
compensation to the owner whose property is destroyed,
makes Courts of Justice extend every possible leniency to
the owner. Moreover it does not contemplate any scheme
for the reconstruction of the houses demolished, or other
provision for population displaced….”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for St. James’,
Westminster, where no action was taken under it,
wrote <span class="no-break">(1872–3):—</span></p>

<p>“It is scarcely necessary to say that such an Act could
not be acted upon without the grossest injustice to the
owners of property, and the infliction of the greatest
hardship on the poor.”</p>

<p>But there was another view, much nearer justice, which
was given expression to before the Select Committee
in 1881.</p>

<p>“An owner of property who allowed his property to fall
into such a miserable state as to be unfit for human habitation
is not a man that deserves the slightest consideration
of any kind from Parliament—he ought to be treated rather
as a criminal than an owner of property. To compensate
him is a mistake entirely.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel said it
was his opinion <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“If the landlord leaves his house in a very bad state, and
will not listen to any representations, he ought not to be
paid by the public when he is creating a nuisance.”</p>

<p>The Act of 1868 having helped so little to a solution of
the housing problem, and the matter being one of ever-increasing
urgency, an effort was made to deal with it
in 1875, when a Bill for facilitating the improvement of
the working classes in large towns was introduced into
Parliament by Sir R. A. Cross, and was carried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>It often happened that in some of the worst slums, the
houses were the property of several owners, and it was not
therefore in the power of any one owner to make such
alterations as were necessary for the public health.</p>

<p>The Act<a id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> of 1875 <span class="no-break">contemplated—</span></p>

<p>“Dealing with whole areas, where the houses are so
structurally defective as to be incapable of repair, and
so ill-placed with reference to each other as to require, to
bring them up to a proper sanitary standard, nothing
short of demolition and reconstruction. Accordingly, in
this case, the local authority, armed with compulsory
powers, at once enters as a purchaser, and on completion
of the purchase proceeds forthwith to a scheme of
reconstruction.”<a id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>An official representation, that the houses within a
particular area were unfit for human habitation, was to
be made to the Central Authority, the Metropolitan Board
of Works, by the Medical Officer of Health of a Vestry
or District Board, and the Metropolitan Board was empowered
to declare the same to be an unhealthy area,
and to make an improvement scheme in respect of it.
If it decided that an improvement scheme ought to be
made, it should forthwith make such a scheme, which,
after sundry formalities, was embodied in a Provisional
Order which had to be confirmed by Parliament.</p>

<p>The compensation to be paid for the property so taken
might be settled by agreement between the Metropolitan
Board of Works and the owner, but where no agreement
was arrived at, an arbitrator was to be appointed by the
Secretary of State. The arbitrator was to assess the compensation
at the fair market value of the lands concerned,
due regard being had to the nature and then condition of
the property, but no additional allowance was to be made
in respect of the compulsory purchase of the area.</p>

<p>The value settled, and the land having passed into the
hands of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the obligation
was imposed on that body of pulling down the buildings,
and selling, or letting, the cleared ground for the erection
of improved dwellings for the same number of people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The hardship of working class and poorer persons being
turned out of houses and no other accommodation being
provided for them was formally recognised in this matter,
and the scheme had to provide for <span class="no-break">the—</span></p>

<p>“Accommodation of at the least as many persons of the
working class as may be displaced in the area … in
suitable dwellings which, unless there are any reasons to
the contrary, shall be situate within the limits of the same
area, or in the vicinity thereof. It shall also provide for
proper sanitary arrangements.”</p>

<p>The Act was intended to relieve owners of such property
without loss or benefit, and several representations as to unhealthy
areas were made to the Metropolitan Board. The
facts stated in these representations and subsequently
brought out in evidence in the public inquiries held, were
illuminating as to the terrible depths which the conditions
of life of numbers of the people had been allowed to reach,
without the intervention of the law, or the staying hand of
the freeholder, lessees, or sub-lessees, who derived financial
profit from the property.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Limehouse described
one of <span class="no-break">them:—</span></p>

<p>“The area, though not large, contained abominations
sufficient for an area three times its size. Here were
crowded houses, built no one knows when; how they
stood was a marvel, their walls bulged, their floors sunk,
an indescribable musty odour pervaded them; water supply,
drainage, closets, all were bad, and in my opinion,
nothing could remedy such a state of things short of
pulling down the rickety buildings.”</p>

<p>“The area is inhabited by about 800 people, and the
death-rate is about 36 per 1,000.”</p>

<p>In another of these schemes, in one Court (Sugar Loaf
Court) the death-rate was 105·2 per 1,000.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for the Strand gave a
report on the sanitary state of <span class="no-break">Bedfordbury:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bedfordbury is the black spot of this parish. It and the
contiguous courts are a little over three acres. Population
census of 1871 = 2,163. It is a long narrow street of 47
houses with courts leading out of it on either side. Some
of the courts are blind and very narrow, thus rendering
light and air difficult of access.</p>

<p>“These 47 houses are so old and dilapidated that it is
quite impossible to make them fit and proper habitation
for the poor to live in.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Even this bright and sunny morning the staircases were
so dark that you could not see a single stair—there was not
a scrap of ventilation, and no means of getting light or air
to them.</p>

<p>“No. 37 is occupied by 33 people living in six rooms; on
the second floor the two rooms are tenanted by two families,
respectively five and seven, and the third floor by two
families of six each.”</p>

<p>No. 41 was very similar. “These two houses may be
taken as a type of the condition of the houses in Bedfordbury.”</p>

<p>“Off this street were various Courts, one of them of six
three-roomed houses; its width three feet five. Another
Court—seven houses, 20 rooms in all—population 71. All of
them apparently as bad, or worse, than those in the street—miserable
hovels, the birthplace of disease and vice,
and centres for infectious diseases, which are likely to
spread through the whole community.”</p>

<p>The births and deaths were almost equivalent. In 1872,
there were 92 births and 95 deaths. In 1873, there were
108 births and 108 deaths.</p>

<p>“In 1874, there were 95 deaths and only 82 births. The
deaths are exclusive of those people who have been removed
from the neighbourhood and gone elsewhere to
die, either in the hospital or the workhouse, where a
great many people at the present time do go to die.”</p>

<p>Of the overcrowded rooms he <span class="no-break">says:—</span></p>

<p>“Here legions of crimes and legions of vices unite,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
fostering diseases of body, weakened intellect, and utter
destruction of the soul; leading inevitably to a career of
wickedness and sin.”</p>

<p>Confirmatory of the Medical Officer of Health’s description,
was that given in a memorial to the Metropolitan
Board by 118 persons: “The Clergy, Medical Men,
Bankers, Residents, Professional men, and Traders of the
parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, in support of a scheme
of improvement.”</p>

<p>“Bedfordbury, with its swarming, ill-built, badly ventilated,
rotten, inappropriate, unsavoury tenements, has seemed
to us a very forcing pit of immorality.”</p>

<p>“In it there are 797 people living on one acre of
land.”</p>

<p>“There is a very large number of interests to be paid for.
There is first the freeholder; then there is the first lessee;
then there are numbers of under-lessees, and all the trades
of those little shops, and they ought all to get something.”</p>

<p>And another area was the “Great Wild Street Scheme,”
in the parish of St. Giles’-in-the-Fields.<a id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>“This area has long been a hot-bed of disease. It contains
about 5½ acres, and 227 houses stand upon it inhabited
by 3,897 persons.</p>

<p>“Many of the courts and passages are approached by a
narrow passage under a house at either end which renders
ventilation very defective. Some of the houses are built
close together and have dark passages and staircases, others
have no back yards, and their sanitary arrangements are
placed in the basement. Health under such circumstances
is impossible. This part of St. Giles’ has long been noted
for its heavy sick and death rates, especially from diseases
of the respiratory and pulmonary organs, and from typhus
fever and other zymotic disorders in their most contagious
forms.”<a id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Lovett, the Medical Officer of Health, stated that
diseases were very rife in it, and a very high rate of
mortality as compared with the number of cases.</p>

<p>And he added, “The district is a nest of zymotic diseases
of the most contagious kind. In 1874, 27 cases of typhus
were sent to Stockwell Hospital. This state of things
cannot be dealt with under Torrens’ Act. The houses are
built so close together, the people are so huddled together
… you must make a clean sweep of the
buildings.”</p>

<p>Another of these insanitary areas was Pear Tree Court,
in Clerkenwell, “consisting of small tenements of an
exceedingly inferior description. All are more or less
calculated to engender disease and filth. The condition
of the property has been such as to be a reproach to the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>“Occupied by the very poorest of the community. When
disease made its appearance it has been fostered and engendered
and continued by the state in which the property
and its surroundings have been—the death-rate is nearly
double of that which prevails over the whole parish.</p>

<p>“Some of the tenements are of the most wretched description—some
constructed of lath and plaster—some wooden
houses—the floors rotted partly by the cisterns, partly by
rain coming in.</p>

<p>“In some cases the sanitary convenience is in the very
rooms themselves—also the water-butt—thereby engendering
and perpetuating the worst kind of zymotic disease: the
chosen home of fever and also of smallpox.</p>

<p>“An entire absence of ventilation.</p>

<p>“… When we come to those occupying only one room
each, and remembering that in many of these rooms the
closet, the water-butt, the water supply, and everything else
was contained in the room itself, and that there was no provision
for manure, ashes, or refuse of any kind, you can
easily conceive what a wretched state of things that presents.
On the average there were 2·80 persons per room permanently
occupying them. So it cannot be wondered at an
outbreak of the zymotic disease finding a resting-place
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
there, and that such a locality becomes a plague spot in the
neighbourhood, and extends its ravages thence into healthier
neighbourhoods.”</p>

<p>Some of the houses the Medical Officer of Health had
known to be in the same state for the last 36 years.</p>

<p>“… An ill-constructed, unhealthy warren;” some were
“regular old shanties—you could hardly find anything like
those in the metropolis, they are worth looking at as a
curiosity.”</p>

<p>“Some in Clerkenwell Close are large and very old wooden
houses, all tumbledown. There is no straight line in roof or
windows—the windows are like cabin windows.”</p>

<p>One more case is worth giving details about, as it is one
of those rare cases in which one gets a more continuous
account of the effects of slum ownership than is usually
accessible.<a id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>This was the Little Coram Street scheme, in St. George,
Bloomsbury, in St. Giles’ District, comprising 119 houses—1,027
inhabitants.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health, in his representation to
the Metropolitan Board, gave a minute description of the
place.</p>

<p>“The houses are principally let to cab owners, who stable
their horses in the lower floor, and reside with their families
in the rooms over; they are without back yards, and the
rooms mainly derive their ventilation from the staircase leading
out of the stable, so that the air is contaminated by the
noxious gases which issue from it. All the closets are inside
the houses; there are no dustbins, and the drinking-water
is often obtained from underground tanks, which serve both
for stable, cleaning, and culinary purposes.</p>

<p>“These houses are unfit for human habitation.”</p>

<p>“The district now represented as unfit, &amp;c., constitutes the
worst part of the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury, and
has been notorious for years as largely contributing to the
sick and death rates of the sub-district.”</p>

<p>In 1862 it was reported that it had “habitually a much
higher mortality than the rest of the parish.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>
<p>In the following years “the mortality was seriously
increasing there.”</p>

<p>In 1870 smallpox broke out first in it, and 25 cases occurred
in a short time. During the same year the deaths in
Chapel Place from three classes of disease—the zymotic,
pulmonary, and tubercular—having been 17, the death-rate
to population was 70 per 1,000 without reckoning those from
other causes.</p>

<p>In 1871 the general mortality was 50 per cent. greater in it
than that in the parish, whilst that of cholera was four times
greater.</p>

<p>In 1874, nine cases of typhoid and typhus fevers occurred
in it, “and the locality was conspicuous for diseases and
premature deaths.”</p>

<p>In 1876 scarlet fever was prevalent.</p>

<p>Asked what class of disease the people chiefly suffer from,
the Medical Officer of Health <span class="no-break">replied:—</span></p>

<p>“Mostly from debility—zymotic diseases, and infectious
diseases—such as whooping cough, typhus, typhoid fever,
cholera, diarrhœa, measles, scarlet-fever, &amp;c., &amp;c., smallpox,
and gin liver disease…. They are obliged to resort
to gin on account of the close and depressing condition
in which the people live in these Courts free from the
public eye.</p>

<p>“The women have to stop at home; they do not get out,
and therefore do not get any excitement. Then they take
their drops. You can often see women at twelve o’clock in
the day drinking in public-houses.”</p>

<p>The Parochial District Medical Officer <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“The houses are so old that the air is really poisonous;
it is full of miasma and dirt … all the whitewashing and
ventilation in the world would do no good. The condition
of the property has got worse year by year.”</p>

<p>These are but some of the cases about which “representations”
were made to the Metropolitan Board of Works—sufficient,
however, as illustration of others. And what an
awful and appalling picture they present. Had the condition
described been only temporary, a mere passing phase, it
would have been dreadful enough; but it had been going on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
for years—it was permanently so—producing year after year
its fearful crop of misery and crime, of disease and death,
and scattering broadcast the seeds of disease and death, the
“owners” all the while exacting the uttermost farthing
they could in rents from the miserable inhabitants, and
placidly and remorselessly giving disease and death in
return: going on, too, during twenty years of government
by “local authority”—Vestry and District Board—and
nearly ten years after the passing of the Sanitary Act of
1866, with its provisions for the abatement of overcrowding
and the maintenance of a certain standard of
cleanliness.</p>

<p>A few years’ experience of the working of the Housing
Act of 1875 proved that it was dilatory, cumbrous, and
costly to the ratepayers of London.</p>

<p>The arbitrator frequently awarded to owners of places
unfit for habitation compensation equal or almost equal in
amount to what would have been given if the houses had
been good and sound. This the Metropolitan Board felt to
be an injustice to the ratepayers upon whom the charge fell,
and an encouragement to owners of houses occupied by
poor people to allow them to fall into or remain in a
dilapidated condition.</p>

<p>In the year 1879 the Board accordingly made representations
to the Government, and suggested that the owners of
unhealthy houses should not be compensated in proportion
to the profit they derived from such houses, but according
to their value as places pronounced unfit for habitation.
The Board also pointed out—“the great loss entailed upon
the ratepayers by the obligation which the Board was under
to provide for the accommodation in suitable dwellings in
the same area of at least as many persons as were displaced.
This obligation rendered it necessary for the Board to sell,
at a very low price, ground, which, with the dilapidated
buildings upon it, had cost the Board seven or eight times as
much, and which, if the Board had been free to dispose of it
for commercial purposes, and to provide for the dispossessed
people elsewhere, would have realised a much higher price.”<a id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>On the six areas which had been sold to the Peabody
Trustees it was estimated that the Board—or in other
words, the ratepayers of London—would lose the large sum
of £562,000.</p>

<p>The Board suggested that it should have power to dispose
of the cleared ground for commercial purposes, and to provide
for the re-housing of the displaced families in other parts of
London.</p>

<p>This latter suggestion was not adopted, but Parliament
passed an Act in 1879 which to some extent lessened, though
it by no means removed the defects of which the Board
complained, for the Board declared that “after careful consideration,
it thought it well not to prepare any more improvement
schemes until some further experience has
been gained of the working of the Amendment Act of
1879.”</p>

<p>And in 1879, also, an Act<a id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> was passed which nominally
“amended,” but in reality destroyed the real good of
Torrens’ Act of 1868, and gave the owner power to require
the local authority to purchase the premises which had
been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and which
the local authorities were to rebuild and hold—thus practically
relieving the worst class of slum house “owners” of
any consequences for their malpractices, relieving them,
too, in the most open way at the expense of the ratepaying
public, as it empowered the Vestry “to levy a rate of
twopence in the pound to bear this expense as well as that
of building sanitary dwellings on the site.”</p>

<p>By one means or another it invariably worked out that
the slum owner obtained large sums for his vile property,
and that the public had to pay heavily for his iniquities.</p>

<p>The work which was within the power of the Vestries
and District Boards to do, in connection with the sanitary
condition of houses, was far more wide-reaching in extent,
and more immediately effective than any the Central
Authority could do under its powers. Practically the
Vestries had under their supervision the sanitary condition
of all the houses of London. Moreover they could act upon
their own initiative, whereas the Central Authority could
only act when representations were made to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>But with few exceptions, they resolutely fought shy of
dealing with the crucial evil—the condition of the tenement-house
population of the metropolis.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health
for Paddington, in 1871, “from the abundant experience
and records of the Sanitary Department of this and other
Vestries, that houses let out in single rooms, and to several
families, have endangered the life of people, have favoured
the spread of contagion, and are a source of pauperism and
degradation.”</p>

<p>The various Health Acts gave them power to deal with
most of the prevalent nuisances.</p>

<p>But no Act gave them such rapid and effective means of
action, or so fixed upon the owner the responsibility and
cost of keeping his houses which he let as tenement-houses
in proper sanitary order, as did the Act of 1866 by its
35th Section.</p>

<p>This Act had conferred power upon them to make effective
bye-laws or regulations as regarded such houses; and in
1874 the Sanitary Law Amendment Act conferred further
powers upon them. Regulations could now be made as to
the paving and drainage of premises, the ventilation of
rooms, the separation of the sexes, and to securing notices
being given to the Medical Officer of Health, and precautions
being taken in case of any dangerously infectious disease
occurring in a registered house.</p>

<p>By such regulations the notification of infectious disease
occurring in tenement-houses could have been made compulsory,
and such notification would have been of the very
utmost value in enabling sanitary authorities to combat the
ravages of infectious disease.</p>

<p>The regulations struck at the root of the very worst and
most prevalent evils in the homes of the people, and had
they been enforced, would have been a charter of health to
millions of the people.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Chelsea, in one of his
reports, well enforced their importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>“When it is remembered that the whole of the labouring
population occupies but part of the house in which their
families live; that in many houses three or four families
live together; and not infrequently each family occupies
only a single room; and when it is considered that whenever
necessary all such houses may be registered, it will at once
be seen how important is this regulation.”<a id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>These sections nevertheless remained absolutely a dead
letter in nearly every one of the metropolitan districts, and
even the newly constituted Local Government Board did
not exercise its power of declaring them to be in force in
any district.</p>

<p>From a return compiled in 1874 it appears <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) In only seven parishes or districts<a id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> were regulations
made and enforced; how imperfectly even in these is illustrated
by Lambeth where, in 1873, 47 houses only had been
registered—there being 29,000 in the parish, one half of
which were probably let in lodgings.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) In six districts regulations were made but no attempt
made to enforce them.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) And in twenty-five parishes or districts no regulations
whatever had been made.</p>

<p>In Hackney and Chelsea alone was any widespread use
made of the regulation.</p>

<p>The explanation usually put forward of the determination
on the part of the Vestries not to enforce the sanitary laws
as regarded houses was their regard for the financial interests
of the ratepayers. But the real ground of their aversion
was that action would put house-owners to expense.
“Vested rights in filth and dirt” were strongly represented
on the Vestries and District Boards.</p>

<p>As a witness said before a Select Committee in <span class="no-break">1882:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“So long as vestrymen own little properties, and so long
as their relations and friends do the same thing, and they
are all mixed up in a friendly association, you can never get
the prevention of the continuance of unhealthy tenements
carried through.”<a id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>And not only was there a passive but often an active
opposition to work being performed which it was their duty
to do.</p>

<p>A general inspection would have shown what houses
ought to have been made subject to such regulations, but it
would also have exposed too publicly the iniquities of house-owners,
and would have entailed a heavy expense on those
who left the houses in a perpetual state of dilapidation, insanitation,
and filth; and so the staff of inspectors was kept
as low as possible.</p>

<p>A thorough enforcement of the regulations would have
necessitated a supervision of their houses by the owners in
addition to expense.</p>

<p>Many straws showed which way the wind blew. Thus
the Medical Officer of Health for Bethnal Green <span class="no-break"><span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></span></p>

<p>“It is by the constant inspection and reinspection of
property inhabited by careless and destructive tenants that
most good can be done. I recently felt it my duty to
recommend a house-to-house inspection of the whole
parish—a procedure urgently required to ascertain the
condition of the drainage and water supply arrangements.
I regret to say this recommendation was not acted
upon.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for St. Pancras, in referring
to house-to-house inspection, <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“This most important branch of all sanitary work has
received as much attention as the number of the sanitary
staff will admit.”</p>

<p>And so the regulations were not made, or if made were
not enforced. And, as the result, the great masses of the
working classes, and the poorer classes in the metropolis,
were by the deliberate decision of the great majority of
Vestries and District Boards deprived of the protection
which Parliament had devised and provided for their sanitary
and physical well-being; and all the well-known evils of
overcrowding were indefinitely perpetuated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>
<p>Apart from the sense of duty or responsibility to the
people which ought to have appealed to them, there were
other motives which might have done so.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Paddington called
attention to one of them in 1872. He <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The costliness of preventable disease is enormous.</p>

<p>“(<em>a</em>) Sanitary supervision. (<em>b</em>) Removal to hospitals.
(<em>c</em>) Disinfection. (<em>d</em>) Expenses in hospital. (<em>e</em>) Cost of
burial. (<em>f</em>) Loss of work in wages. (<em>g</em>) Loss of life to the
community. (<em>h</em>) Cost of widows and children.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel wrote
in <span class="no-break">1871:—</span></p>

<p>“… As the local rates are continually increasing for
the relief of sickness and the support of widows and orphans,
the building of asylums for the insane, and the providing of
workhouse infirmaries for the debilitated and prematurely
old, it is probable that local boards will direct more attention
to the condition of the houses of the poor than they have
hitherto done.”</p>

<p>The cost was brought home to them in 1871—“an exceptional
year of mortality caused by the continued spread of
smallpox.”</p>

<p>“It has been,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for
Lambeth, “one of the most alarming and expensive epidemics
that have visited the country for a century. The
cost in a pecuniary sense has been great, but it is nothing
as compared to the cost of human life.</p>

<p>“… I know of no disease that can be made so preventable
as this.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. George-the-Martyr
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“No extravagance can be compared with that of sanitary
neglect. Pounds are willingly paid for cure, where ha’pence
would be grudged to prevent. Some diseases we can create,
most we can propagate, and send on their errand of misery
and destruction.”</p>

<p>In 1878 the Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel
again referred to the <span class="no-break">subject:—</span></p>

<p>“It may be asserted without fear of contradiction, that all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
money laid out for the improvement of the public health
will secure an ample dividend….</p>

<p>“The alleviation of suffering and the prolongation of
human life is the duty of every noble-minded man to endeavour
to promote.</p>

<p>“It cannot be too frequently reiterated, too extensively
known, that the rich not only pay a heavy pecuniary penalty,
but often suffer a heavy affliction in themselves and families
by neglecting to improve the sanitary condition of the
houses and localities occupied by the poor. It is well known
that defective sanitary arrangements in the poorer localities
are the chief causes of disease among the poor, and when a
contagious disease is once located it soon assumes an epidemic
form and attacks, indiscriminately, all classes of the
people.”</p>

<p>These views were sound and true, but the contingencies
described always appeared remote, and arguments of more
immediate and remunerative results were constantly present.</p>

<p>If the conduct of the Vestries and District Boards was
reprehensible for not administering the existing laws for the
improvement of the sanitary condition of the poorer classes,
and if the consequences of their deliberate inaction were so
fatal to the lives of countless thousands of the people and
so disastrous to the well-being of the community, the conduct
of the “owners” of the houses, for the manner in which
they allowed their tenants to live, was still more so.</p>

<p>“I often wonder,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health
for St. George-the-Martyr (1874–5), “what many of the
owners of property think man was created for except indeed
that he should be housed in foul, wretched dwellings in
order that money may be put in their purses, and so they
may reap where they have not sown. A grim kind of
harvest that will prove. Surely the owners have neither
humanity nor justice on their side when they allow their
houses to become hotbeds for the fostering and spreading of
disease, moral and physical, and in which it is impossible
either to maintain cleanliness, or support health, or practice
morality. There are thousands of such houses….</p>

<p>“The only true and lasting foundation upon which the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
glory and safety of a nation can be built, must be upon the cultivation
of the moral and physical powers belonging to man.”</p>

<p>The “owners” were of all classes.</p>

<p>An experienced witness<a id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> before the Committee of 1881,
who had acted as arbitrator in some of these cases, referring
to some of the worst slum areas in London, <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“It came before me that a great many people in life
better than that supposed, do draw considerable incomes
from insanitary house property.”</p>

<p>“Some of these worst places are held by rich gentlemen
and ladies.”</p>

<p>“The class of landlords we have here are very shrewd
money-making men, and they would not show much consideration
to their tenants.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. George-the-Martyr,
Southwark, reported <span class="no-break">(1876–7):—</span></p>

<p>“We have heard denounced, times out of number, and in
the strongest terms, the conduct of the holders of small
property as being most selfish, and they themselves the
most persistent and obstinate opponents of sanitary
measures and improvements; and moreover that this
class formed a considerable portion of our Vestries. However
this may be, they cannot claim a monopoly to this
unenviable distinction….</p>

<p>“Much of the small class property is placed in the hands
of agents who neither hold nor cultivate any interest in the
welfare and comfort of the tenants.</p>

<p>“To get the most rent with the least possible trouble and
outlay seems to comprise their whole duty (of course there
are exceptions).</p>

<p>“How much better in all respects would it be that the
owner himself should give some personal supervision to his
property and to the state of those who dwell in it.”</p>

<p>And there was another class of “owners”—the middlemen—“the
very curse that is incident in all society.”</p>

<p>“There are a great many middlemen dealing with these properties. A
great deal of it is to let out in lodgings. A man goes and buys this
wretched property at public auction in different parts of London to pay
him 10 or 12 per cent., and he underlets it at so much a room to weekly
tenants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is these small men who go into it to make a profit,
and screw the poor, wretched holders down to the last
farthing—in fact they get as much as they can out of the
property, and do as little as they can.”</p>

<p>Some of the Medical Officers of Health referred to the
difficulties of getting the “owners” to do anything to keep
their property in order.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for St. James’ wrote
<span class="no-break">(1877–8):—</span></p>

<p>“On eastern border of parish a large number of houses
are now increasingly being underleased in order to be let
out as tenement-houses…. Dealers in these houses make
enormous aggregate rentals out of the improvident working
people whom they thus herd together; and persistent efforts
on the part of the sanitary officers are needed to goad some
of these ‘landlords’ into keeping their ‘property’ in a decent
condition.”</p>

<p>With a very large number of house-owners and other
sanitary misdoers, nothing but the vigorous administration
of the law would induce them to abate nuisances or do
anything for their tenants.</p>

<p>“I am quite sure,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health
for Hackney in 1880, “that a prompt and strict enforcement
of the various sanitary Acts is beneficial not only to
tenants, but landlords, because the latter will not allow
tenants to occupy their houses who frequently bring them
under the notice of the sanitary officers.”</p>

<p>With many, however, the fact that the law had been put
in force against them, and would, if necessary, again be put
in force was sufficient.</p>

<p>“The number of statutory notices this year was not
much more than half. Owners have carried out the
necessary works for fear of being summoned.”</p>

<p>And numerous other reports were to the same effect.
But a vigorous administration of the sanitary laws against
owners was the very last thing which it was of use looking
to the Vestries or District Boards for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the Vestries and District Boards put pressure
upon their Medical Officers of Health to prevent energy
upon their part.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for St. Pancras in
1875 tendered his resignation, giving the following <span class="no-break">reasons:—</span></p>

<p>“That while I am held responsible for the sanitary condition
of the parish, I am denied that assistance in outdoor
inspection of houses either visited with contagious diseases
or habitually in an unsatisfactory condition, which I believe
to be necessary. I feel that the severe condemnation which
a house-to-house visitation of the poorer parts of the parish
has received from a majority of the sanitary committee
must of necessity hopelessly weaken my authority with the
sanitary inspectors, and render nugatory my efforts to carry
out the Sanitary Acts….”</p>

<p>Parliament was passing some useful legislation for the
improvement of the public health, and taking some action
against some of the more heinous existing abuses.</p>

<p>Several of the evils already described connected with the
building of houses were dealt with in an Act<a id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> passed in 1878.
It was at last declared to be—“expedient to make provisions
with respect to the making, filling up, and preparation
of the foundation of sites of houses and buildings to be
erected within the metropolis, and with respect to the
quality of the substances to be used in the formation or
construction of the sites, foundations and walls of such
houses with a view to the stability of the same, the prevention
of fires, and for purposes of health.”</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Board of Works was empowered to
make bye-laws respecting the foundations and sites of
houses to be constructed, and with respect to the material
used in the construction of such houses and of the walls and
buildings; and the Board issued a set of comprehensive
regulations upon the subject.</p>

<p>“Considerable opposition was manifested by builders
before the Secretary of State.”</p>

<p>But, nevertheless, the regulations were sanctioned and
approved.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>
<p>And in the same year (1878) Parliament had passed an
Act which materially improved the sanitary conditions
under which men, women, and children worked in factories
and workshops.<a id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Guided by experience, Parliament had gradually been
extending the operation of the previous Acts from one trade
to another, and as Lord Shaftesbury <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“The general result had been to introduce and establish
a system of order, content, and satisfaction. The children
in the factories presented quite a different appearance from
that which was their characteristic in former times; they
were now hale and stout.”</p>

<p>And the Factory and Workshops Royal Commission<a id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> in
1876 <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The improvement in the sanitary arrangements and
ventilation of factories had been most marked in recent
years; and the cases in which young persons and women
suffer in labour unfitted for their years, or in which young
persons and women suffer physically from overwork, are
now, we believe, as uncommon as formerly they were
common.</p>

<p>“Much of this great improvement is undoubtedly due to
factory legislation.”</p>

<p>The Act directed <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>“A factory or workshop should be kept in a cleanly state
and free from effluvia arising from any drain, or other
nuisance.”</p>

<p>And that they should “not be so overcrowded while work
is carried on therein as to be injurious to the health of the
persons employed therein, and should be ventilated in such
a manner as to render harmless, as far as practicable, all the
gases, dust, &amp;c., generated in the course of the manufacturing
process and that may be injurious to health.”</p>

<p>By subsequent order of the Secretary of State, 250 cubic
feet air space were to be given to each adult during the day,
400 cubic feet after eight o’clock at night.</p>

<p>It was to be “the duty of the sanitary authority to make
such inquiry and to take such action thereon as to that
authority may seem proper for the purpose of enforcing the
law.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>A very material factor in the health of the people was
dealt with in this Act—namely, the condition of the bakehouses
where the daily bread of the community was
prepared.</p>

<p>Legislation as to bakehouses had been left unchanged
since the Act of 1863, and in harmony with the usual
disregard of their duties by the local sanitary authorities,
little use was made of that Act.</p>

<p>The Royal Commission of 1875 reported that it was “only
here and there that any active steps had been taken by the
local authorities to carry out the provisions of the Bakehouse
Act.”</p>

<p>By the Act passed in 1878 the Bakehouse Regulation Act
of 1863 was repealed, and the duty of regulating the sanitary
condition of bakehouses was transferred from the local
authority to the Inspectors of Factories.</p>

<p>In 1878, also, the Contagious Diseases Animals Act was
passed. Primarily it was directed to the protection from
cattle plague of the cattle of the country, and the prevention
of the spread of disease, which had been entailing heavy
losses upon their owners, and very stringent precautions
were imposed.</p>

<p>But it contained also some very valuable provisions as to
the condition of cowhouses and dairies, and early in 1879 the
Privy Council issued an Order providing for the registration
of all persons carrying on the trade of cowkeepers and purveyors
of milk, for regulating the lighting, ventilation,
cleansing, drainage, and water supply of dairies and cowsheds,
for securing the cleanliness of milk stores, milk shops, and
milk vessels, and for protecting milk against infection and
contamination.</p>

<p>Inspectors were appointed by the Board.</p>

<p>“At the time of the passing of the Order the London
cowsheds were, with few exceptions, unsuitable in construction
and in sanitary arrangements. By opposing the
renewal of licenses the Metropolitan Board succeeded in
abolishing from two to three hundred of the worst of them,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and obtained improvements, amounting to entire reconstruction,
in the remainder. In the larger dairies and milk
stores much improvement was also effected.”</p>

<p>It was this Act of 1878 which drew from the Medical
Officer of Health for Whitechapel the following remarkable
passages in his report; passages which are enlightening as
to the prevalent views of the time.</p>

<p>“We have a striking instance of the great interest that is
shown in the protection of property and the comparatively
little value that is attached to the health of the people in
the recent Act—‘The Contagious Diseases Animals Act
1878.’</p>

<p>“As regards the laws which are in force for the protection
of the health of cattle, which may be looked upon as
property, I have nothing to complain; but as a health
officer I may express my surprise that similar laws to those
which are now in force respecting disease in cattle are not
enacted to prevent the spreading of infectious and contagious
diseases among the people. At present there is no
general law in force to compel persons, who may become
acquainted with the existence of an infectious disease in a
dwelling-house, to give notice of the same to the Sanitary
Officer….</p>

<p>“Surely it is more important to protect the lives of the
people than to protect from loss the dealers in cattle; but
until the care of public health is considered to be of more
importance than the care of property, little improvement
in the laws relating to health can be expected.”</p>

<p>“The preference which is given by our law makers to the
protection of the supposed vested rights of property above
that of public health is likewise shown by the rejection of
the several Building Bills for the amendment of the Building
Act.</p>

<p>“The opinion of the House appeared to prevail that ‘a man
has a right to do what he likes with his own, as regards the
building of as many houses as can possibly be packed together
on his own land, without taking into consideration
the health of the people who are to inhabit them, or the
health of those in the immediate neighbourhood.’ So long
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
as the Building Act as regards open spaces at the rear of
houses remains unaltered, so long will unhealthy houses
continue to be built.”</p>

<p>Some of the more capable of the Medical Officers of Health
in their reports did not content themselves with mere tables
of the births and diseases and deaths in their parishes, and
a narrative of the principal incidents in their work during
the year, but pointed out the defects in the laws, and made
suggestions as to the best ways of coping with some of the
great sanitary evils daily confronting them.</p>

<p>Based upon actual experience, their views and suggestions
were entitled to great weight, and were often of very great
value.</p>

<p>One point, and that the most important of all, finds expression
in the reports of more than one of them, namely, that
the administration of many of the health laws should be
compulsory instead of permissive, and that merely declaring
a law compulsory without providing the means for making
it compulsory was of little use.</p>

<p>What was wanted in London was a real central authority
which should have power to make the local authorities carry
out the orders of Parliament. This did not exist, for the
Metropolitan Board of Works had no such powers, and the
Vestries and Districts Boards were independent local
governing authorities acknowledging no master and free to
obey or disobey Acts of Parliament just as they pleased.</p>

<p>“It has been one of the great faults of our sanitary
arrangements and legislation for London,” wrote the Medical
Officer of Health for St. James’ in 1872, “that the metropolis
has not been regarded as a whole, and that through the
ignorance, or carelessness, of one District or Local Board
the whole of the others may be put in peril.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“It is impossible, with our present municipal machinery,
in London, at any rate, to exercise all that power which is
necessary for the prevention of the spread of infectious
diseases.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel in
1873 <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“If any alteration is made in the constitution of the
Metropolitan Board of Works it would be desirable to
add to its functions that of a sanitary supervision over the
whole metropolis.”</p>

<p>And in 1881 the Medical Officer of Health for Kensington
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“London is grievously in need of a Central Sanitary
Department to establish something like unity in the sanitary
arrangements of its 39 divisions…. Every other large
centre of population has but one sanitary authority.”</p>

<p>Though much more time, thought, and labour, were
being devoted than ever before to matters relating to the
public health, and with very beneficial results, one
matter appeared to be quite unaffected thereby, for none
of the great measures of sanitary improvement which
had been carried out since the central and local authorities
had come into being seem to have had any effect
during the 1871–80 decade upon infantile mortality.</p>

<p>If anything the figures appear higher. In St. George-in-the-East
in 1871–2 the deaths of children under five
years were 51 per cent. of all the deaths.</p>

<p>In Mile-End-Old-Town in 1872–3, out of a total of
2,200 deaths, 1,087, or practically 50 per cent., were
deaths of children under five, a mortality which evoked
the comment from the Medical Officer of <span class="no-break">Health:—</span></p>

<p>“Apart from congenital causes, a large majority of these
young lives would, under conditions more favourable to
existence, be preserved…. It is certain that the present
generation of London children is physically degenerate.”</p>

<p>And a year later he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“I consider about two-thirds of the infantile mortality
attributable to neglect, improper feeding, impure air
from overcrowding, and general bad management through
ignorance and carelessness of parents and nurses.”</p>

<p>In Kensington, away in the west, the average annual
infantile mortality over a period of ten years—1863–73—was
42 per cent. of the total deaths.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel
wrote <span class="no-break">(1873):—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“There must be something very wrong in the condition
of the people when we find that out of all children born
about one-fifth die before they are one year old, and
one-third before they are five.”</p>

<p>In the north part of his district in the quarter ended
December 28, 1872, the rate of mortality of children
under five was 61·1 per cent., whilst in the quarter
ended September, 1873, in Goodman’s Fields the rate
was 72·4 per cent.</p>

<p>In St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark, in 1873–4, of
1,256 deaths 694 (= 55·3 per cent.) were under five.</p>

<p>In the same year the Medical Officer of Health for
Paddington <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“In taking fifteen streets typical of the ordinary condition
of the dwellings in which the working-class reside,
I find the annual proportion of deaths under five ranges
from 41 to 75 per cent. of the total deaths….</p>

<p>“The deaths from all causes in eighteen such streets varies
from 21·7 to 50 per 1,000.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Limehouse wrote in
<span class="no-break">1874:—</span></p>

<p>“As usual we find that of 1,000 deaths more than 500 are
those of children under five.”</p>

<p>Two years later it was 53 per cent.</p>

<p>Nor was it only in the central parts of London that
the infantile mortality was so frightful. In Wandsworth,
the mean annual rate during the years 1865–74 was
49·6 per cent.</p>

<p>The infantile death-rate did not diminish as the decade
proceeded. In Islington in 1875–6 the infant mortality
was “much about the same” as it had been twelve years
previously.</p>

<p>In Kensington it had increased to 46·3 in 1878; in
St. George-the-Martyr to 57·7 per cent.; in St. Pancras in
1877–8, of 5,068 deaths, 2,212 (or 45·6 per cent.) were of
children under five.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Poplar wrote
<span class="no-break">(1877–8):—</span></p>

<p>“The deaths of children under five years have been more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
than half the total of deaths—truly a ‘massacre of the
Innocents.’”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Islington wrote
<span class="no-break">(1880):—</span></p>

<p>“The number of deaths of children under one year
is still painfully large…. Children seem to be born for
little else than to be buried.”</p>

<p>Passing from record to comment, there are some striking
passages in the reports of the Medical Officers of Health.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for Paddington
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“… Of infantile mortality one is tempted to ask
whether the provision of so much life, such a prodigality of
being, to be followed so soon by an almost Pharaoh sacrifice
of it, is necessary to the multiplication of the race.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for St. Marylebone
<span class="no-break">(1877):—</span></p>

<p>“It is sad, and in a sanitary point of view, humiliating
to contemplate, that for every three children born
in Marylebone, one dies before reaching the age of five
years; ’tis true that in this respect Marylebone stands
in no worse position than other large parishes in the
metropolis, nor so bad as in the majority of them, but
the knowledge of this fact will, I apprehend, afford but
slender consolation to those who know from experience
and daily observation that hereditary diseases, habitual
neglect, unwholesome dwellings, together with other
preventable causes, are largely concerned in the sacrifice
of infant life.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Rotherhithe
<span class="no-break">(1881):—</span></p>

<p>“Whilst the houses’ drain-pipes, from defective construction
and workmanship, and want of being cut off from the
main sewer, act as much as sewer ventilators as channels
for removing filth … whilst overcrowded houses and foul
smells in living and sleeping rooms are taken as a matter of
course; whilst infectious disease is sedulously propagated
first by concealment, and then by criminal exposure and
neglect, … so long the yearly recurring Herodean
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
massacre of helpless children, whose almost sole use in
life appears to be the providing of fees for doctors and
undertakers, will continue, in spite of all efforts of sanitary
authorities and sanitarians.”</p>

<p>The evil done, however, by bad sanitary conditions was
not limited to the children who died. Probably ten or
twenty times the number of those who died went through
the illness and survived—but of those many were injured in
constitution for life.</p>

<p>In other respects, however, sanitary progress was being
made, and slowly but steadily the conditions of the health
of the public were improving. Undoubtedly the main
causes of that progress were the great system of main
drainage and sewerage which had relieved London of the
incubus of enormous accumulations of the deadliest filth
in its houses, and of an open main sewer through its
midst; and the greater quantity, and improved quality,
of the water supplied for household consumption which
relieved her inhabitants from the necessity of drinking
liquid sewage.</p>

<p>And the construction of sewers in nearly all the streets,
and the substitution of an effective system of house
drainage instead of the abomination of cesspools, was also
a great stride to improvement.</p>

<p>Since 1856 plans for the construction of a total length of
nearly 1,000 miles of local sewers had been submitted to
the Metropolitan Board for their approval, many of them
being in substitution of old and shallow ones for which the
Board’s new main and intercepting lines afforded the means
of improving the gradient and outlet.</p>

<p>In their report for 1881 the Metropolitan Board of Works
gave “a brief summary” of what it, as the Central
Authority, had accomplished since 1856.</p>

<p>“There was the great main drainage work which had
cost about five and three-quarter millions, an undertaking
which ‘although fruitful of good results, and of greater
magnitude than anything of a similar kind that had
previously been accomplished, has left, as might be expected,
few visible marks of its existence.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>It is rather the Thames embankments and broad new
streets which remind the inhabitants of London of the great
changes and improvements that the Board’s operations
effected.</p>

<p>“On the north side of the Thames, from Blackfriars to
Westminster, and from Grosvenor Road to Battersea Bridge,
and on the south side, from Westminster to Vauxhall,
embankments have been made which, whilst reclaiming
from the river a considerable extent of ground, have substituted
for the unsightly and offensive mud banks that formerly
prevailed, handsome river walls, with broad and commodious
thoroughfares, relieved and ornamented by public
gardens. New streets have been made, some of the principal
of which are Queen Victoria Street, Southwark Street,
Northumberland Avenue, Commercial Road, and the new
thoroughfare from Oxford Street to Bethnal Green; many
other leading thoroughfares, which had become inadequate
for the increased traffic of the present day, have been
widened and improved, greatly to the convenience and
comfort of the public; and liberal grants of money have
been made by the Board to the authorities in aid of the cost
of smaller street improvements which have not been of
sufficient extent or importance to be carried out by the
Board.</p>

<p>“Two new parks have been provided, in districts previously
unsupplied with such places of needed recreation. Public
gardens have been laid out and are maintained in the
neighbourhood of dense populations; and suburban commons,
to the extent of about 1,500 acres, have by the action of the
Board been secured in perpetuity for the undisturbed
enjoyment of the public.</p>

<p>“Many areas formerly covered with dwellings unfit for
human habitation have been cleared, under the operation of
the Artizans’ and Labourers’ Dwellings Improvement Act,
and the ground let to societies which have undertaken to
build, and in some cases have built, improved dwellings, in
which the humblest class of the working population can
live with health, decency, and comfort.”</p>

<p>These and many consequential improvements, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
better paving of the streets, and the better cleansing of
streets, places, and yards, the more rapid removal of filth
from London, had made the general conditions of life much
less unwholesome.</p>

<p>The work, too, being done by the Metropolitan Asylums
Board was greatly diminishing the dangers of infection in
the metropolis, as well as restoring to life and health
thousands who would otherwise have fallen victims to
disease.</p>

<p>And by “The Poor Law Act, 1879,” the Vestries and
District Boards were authorised to enter into contracts with
the Board, for the reception and treatment of infectious sick
who were not paupers, thus in a measure depauperising the
Metropolitan Asylums Hospitals.</p>

<p>And a very large amount of most valuable work was done
by the Port Sanitary Authority; in the year 1879–80 over
15,000 vessels of all classes having been visited and inspected,
the infectious sick removed, and disinfection carried out.</p>

<p>Writing of the year 1877 the Registrar General <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“London maintains its position as the healthiest city in
the world. During the past year its prosperity was indicated
by a birth-rate above the average of the preceding 10 years,
while a remarkably low death-rate bears testimony to the
success which has attended the efforts that have been made
during the last half of a century to promote the public health
and safety.”</p>

<p>Among the public authorities from which much might have
been hoped in the way of improving the public health of
the inhabitants of London was the School Board. The
Board stood in an exceptionally favourable position for
moulding the physical constitution of hundreds of thousands
of children and of successive generations, but education appeared
to have almost excluded the consideration of health.</p>

<p>In 1871 the Board resolved “that it is highly desirable
that means shall be provided for physical training, exercise
and drill in public elementary schools established under the
Board.” But beyond this, little if anything was done, and
even it was not made applicable to the girls. And no
Medical Officer was appointed, and no systematic means
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
organised for the prevention of the diffusion of diseases by
the schools. Indirectly, however, good results were flowing
from the schools. The attendance of the children at the
schools took them out of their overcrowded tenement-homes
for several hours in the day; their playgrounds afforded
better means of exercise; the cleanliness expected of them
raised their ideas as to cleanliness; the supervision over
them was of great use in improving their conduct and
character, all helped to improve their physical condition.
But how infinitely greater the improvement might have
been, not merely at the time but to the rising generation, if
the School Board had given greater attention to this branch
of the children’s welfare. About 230,000 children were in
attendance in the Board’s Schools in 1880.</p>

<p>The really encouraging feature of the general position
was that a larger section of the public was taking an interest
in matters relating to the public health.</p>

<p>In Battersea, wrote the Medical Officer of Health
<span class="no-break">(1881):—</span></p>

<p>“Much assistance is now derived from the general public,
who are more alive to the necessity of sanitary measures
than at any previous period.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. George-the-Martyr,
Southwark, <span class="no-break">reported:—</span></p>

<p>“The health of the people occupies the thought and
consideration of an ever-increasing number,” and he quoted
the declaration of the head of the Government that “the
sanitary question lies at the bottom of all national well-being.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for North Poplar stated
<span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“Gradually the labouring portion of the population, which
so largely outnumbers the remainder with us, is becoming
educated to the fact that they must neither breathe air,
drink water, nor take food, polluted by filth.”</p>

<p>But, as a whole, public opinion was more or less inert.</p>

<p>“The apathy of the public in matters of health is truly
lamentable.”</p>

<p>Nor was all the apparent progress as genuine as appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
on the surface. The Medical Officer of Health for St. Mary,
Newington, in his report of 1874 disclosed this material fact.</p>

<p>Writing of some Returns which he had prepared of
sickness in seventeen years, he <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“In the period we have seen the end of many fever
haunts. We have seen hundreds and hundreds of the old
tenements removed and new abodes raised in their stead;
but with it, alas! we have seen all the defects of new
buildings, all the defects of badly laid drains, all the evils of
work ill done, its dangers too often not capable of recognition
until sickness and death forced the discovery. We have
seen too often in the new houses defects of ventilation, of
construction, of drainage, and of overcrowding: we have
seen many an evil allowed by law, and over which we
cannot extend our sanitary rules. We have also to contend
with the indifference, the carelessness, the blindness of the
people themselves—intemperance and crime stand in our
way….”</p>

<p>But in 1881 he wrote: “Sanitary work has borne fruit.”</p>

<p>The progress of sanitation is almost necessarily slow.</p>

<p>“There is not,” wrote one of the Medical Officers of
Health, “a more difficult task than that of carrying out
sanitary reform, for although every one agrees that sanitary
laws should be put in force, they are greatly objected to
when they interfere with one’s self.”</p>

<p>And another <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Nuisances crop up, are removed, and re-appear. <em>It is a
continuous warfare due to many causes</em>, such as carelessness
and wilfulness on the one hand, and accidental circumstances
on the other.”</p>

<p>And <span class="no-break">another:—</span></p>

<p>“The sanitary labours of your officers increase year by
year as the population becomes denser, and the need for
sanitary precautions grows more urgent.”</p>

<p>And underneath all was the view expressed by the Medical
Officer of Health for Islington <span class="no-break">(1881):—</span></p>

<p>“I fear the public have not even yet learned to regard
health as a matter of infinitely greater moment than rates
and taxes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>How far-reaching were the effects of disease was admirably
set forth by <span class="no-break">Dr. Simon:—</span></p>

<p>“I do not pretend to give any exact statement of the
total influence which preventable diseases exert against the
efficiency and happiness of our population, for it is only so
far as such diseases kill, and even thus far but very imperfectly,
that the effect can be reported in numbers. Of
the incalculable amount of physical suffering and disablement
which they occasion, and of the sorrows, and anxieties,
the permanent darkening of life, the straitened means of
such subsistence, the very frequent destitution and pauperism
which attend or follow such suffering, death statistics testify
only in sample or by suggestion.”<a id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Few people realise the infinite importance of health to a
great community.</p>

<p>As one of the Medical Officers of Health truly <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“It is a question whether the greatness of countries will
not in future to a very large extent depend upon the
standard of public health.”</p>

<p>One of the very best and most experienced of the men
who held the responsible office of Medical Officer of Health
during the last half century—Dr. Bateson, the Medical
Officer of Health for St. George in Southwark—in his
reports often dwelt upon this aspect of the <span class="no-break">subject:—</span></p>

<p>“The only true and lasting foundation upon which the
glory and safety of a nation can be built must be upon the
cultivation of the moral and physical powers belonging to
man.”</p>

<p>“… The quality of a race is of far more importance
than the quantity.”</p>

<p>“Health to the majority of the population is their only
wealth; without it they become pauperised.”</p>

<p>“The welfare and safety of this country need a healthy,
stalwart race of men—men who can labour and endure.”</p>

<p>And in his last report (1878), after twenty years’ service
as Medical Officer of Health, he quoted the Prime Minister
(Lord Beaconsfield) as <span class="no-break">saying:—</span></p>

<p>“The health of a people was really the foundation upon
which all their happiness and all their powers as a state
depended. If the population of a country was stationary,
or that it yearly diminished, or that whilst it diminished it
diminished also in stature and strength, then that country
was ultimately doomed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Dr. Bateson, “could be more solemn
and emphatic.”</p>

<p>“For the success and permanence of national existence a
high standard of health is absolutely necessary. To maintain
in its integrity the vast power which England now
wields, and to retain the high position which she now holds
will depend upon the nation’s health.”</p>

<p>Before considerations such as these, how lamentable the
blindness of those who could not see that even a measurable
expenditure in health matters would have been productive
of immeasurable benefits; how reprehensible the conduct of
those who refused to administer laws which it was their
duty to administer, and the administration of which would
have been of inestimable value to their fellow citizens; and
how disastrous their studied inaction to the great metropolis,
and through it, to the nation itself.</p>

<h2 class="chaptHead"><a id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">1881–1890</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">The</span> census of 1881 showed that the population of London
was 3,816,483 persons—an increase this time of well over
half a million of persons in the decade.</p>

<p>In the central parts of London, with the single exception
of Clerkenwell, the resident population continued to decrease.
In the City, the decrease was nearly one-third; in the
Strand nearly a fifth, and the parish of St. George, Hanover
Square, was now added to the list of those on the decline.</p>

<p>In the East, in Whitechapel, Shoreditch, and St. George-in-the-East,
the population had declined, whilst in Bethnal
Green the increase had been at a much slower rate. But
Mile-End-Old-Town, where there had been a good extent of
unbuilt-on ground, had added over 12,000 to its population;
and Poplar over 40,000.</p>

<p>In the North, with the single exception of St. Marylebone,
all the parishes showed increases; Hackney, the great
increase of over 60,000, and Islington the still larger one
of nearly 70,000.</p>

<p>In the West, there were large increases in Paddington
and Chelsea, in Kensington an increase of over 42,000, and in
Fulham over 48,000. In the parishes nearer the centre—St.
George, Hanover Square, St. James’ (Westminster), and
Westminster, the population had decreased.</p>

<p>On the south side of the river, with the exception of the
parishes of St. Olave, and St. Saviour—both in Southwark,
and near the City—every parish or district showed an
increase. Notably was this the case in Camberwell, where
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
the increase was 75,000, and most remarkable of all,
Wandsworth, where the huge increase of over 85,000
persons was recorded.</p>

<p>Thus the movements of population were shown by this
census of 1881 to be very much on the same lines as those
in 1871—a diminution in the central parts, and increases of
various magnitudes in the outer parts.</p>

<p>Interesting information was once more given as regarded
the constituent parts of the population.</p>

<p>It was shown that of the residents in London in 1881, the
proportion of persons born in London was practically the
same as in 1871. Of every 1,000 inhabitants in London,
628 were born in London, 308 in the rest of England
and Wales, 13 in Scotland, and 21 in Ireland—the rest
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The flow of people from the country to London was thus
continuing at much the same rate, and the metropolis was
still being fed with labour at the expense of the agricultural
districts.<a id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>“A contingent untrained in the pursuits of town life”
was thus annually thrown upon the labour market of
London. But they imported a fresh strain of healthy
country people into the constituent elements of the town
population, and helped to stay part of the deterioration
which necessarily ensued from the insanitary conditions of
life in London.</p>

<p>As to the causes of the shifting of the population in
London, the same story continued to be told by the Medical
Officers of Health.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for the Strand wrote
<span class="no-break">(1882–3):—</span></p>

<p>“The material decrease in population is largely connected
with the gradual transition of houses from residences into
business premises, the construction of new and wider
thoroughfares, and the erection of public buildings, combined
with the resulting consequence inevitably associated
with such changes, a considerable augmentation in the
rental or annual value of house property.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>In St. James’ <span class="no-break">(1882)—</span></p>

<p>“The large decrease of population (3,754 in last decade),
coupled with the fact that the rateable value still has an
upward tendency, clearly shows that the character of the
parish is undergoing rapid change—offices, warehouses, and
clubs taking the place of residences as the centre of trade
continues to increase and move westward, and greater
facilities are afforded for business men to live in the
suburbs.”</p>

<p>Some of the Medical Officers of Health were perturbed by
the class of persons coming into their district. Thus the
Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel drew attention to
the fact that of the 70,435 people in his parish no fewer than
9,660 were foreigners, mostly Russian and Polish Jews.
Others of them were feeling anxious under the ever increasing
numbers.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Paddington wrote
<span class="no-break">(1881):—</span></p>

<p>“Occupying, as the population of Paddington does, a
limited area with definite boundaries which do not admit of
extension, a continually increasing population can only mean
a continually increasing complexity of the problems of sanitation.”</p>

<p>Upon one most interesting point as regarded the influx of
population into London the Medical Officer of Health for
Lambeth threw some valuable light.<a id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>“The evil of overcrowding is aggravated by causes which
derive their origin from the effects of that condition itself.
A lowered standard of health, always the accompaniment of
close building, is a factor in the further increase of pressure
in an already congested district. An unsatisfied demand in
the labour market for physical strength is a necessary outcome
of that quality in the district affected. Muscle and
bone in such a locality is at a premium, and that which
cannot be supplied in its full development from within must
be sought and obtained from without.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>
<p>“Here, then, is a vicious circle of concurrent cause and
effect. Overcrowding is the cause of physical weakness:
physical weakness results in an unsatisfied demand in the
labour market: the unsatisfied demand is the cause of an influx
from without: again that influx results in overcrowding.”</p>

<p>Once, then, that the influx of the physically strong began
to diminish—the element which had contributed most to the
maintenance of the physical vigour and health of the population
of London—it was evident that deterioration would
ensue, and the only means of counteracting that result was
to improve to the utmost possible the sanitary conditions
in which the people lived.</p>

<p>The census of 1881 is remarkable as being the last to show
an increase of country-born immigrants into London. That
tide was soon to begin to ebb.</p>

<p>The immigrants, however, were far from being all of a
desirable character.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Camberwell pointed
this <span class="no-break">out:—</span></p>

<p>“A considerable percentage of our population is composed
of persons whose natural tendency is to grovel—beggars,
thieves, prostitutes, drunkards, persons of feeble intelligence,
persons of lazy and improvident habits, and persons who
(like too many of the poor) marry or cohabit prematurely
and procreate large families for which they are totally unable
to provide; and such persons gravitate from all quarters to
large towns and there accumulate…. A large town like
London will always attract undesirable residents.”</p>

<p>With the increasing population the number of houses in
the metropolis increased also.</p>

<p>From 418,802 inhabited houses in 1871 the number had
gone up to 488,116 in 1881, and the same tale was told as to
the crowding of houses on the land as in previous years.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Bethnal Green (1880)
stated that in his parish most of the available ground was
already fully built over. The Great Eastern Railway Company,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
the School Board for London, and the Metropolitan
Board of Works, were largely demolishing small house
property. “If this sort of thing goes on much longer,” he
wrote, “it looks very much as if London in a few years
would become a huge agglomeration of Board Schools, intersected
by railways and new streets.”</p>

<p>The correct record of the population enabled once more
an accurate death-rate to be calculated. The death-rate,
which had been 24·6 per 1,000 in 1871, had fallen to 21·3 in
1881.</p>

<p>That was most gratifying testimony to the good results
following the sanitary work carried out, under many difficulties,
in London, and an encouragement to perseverance.</p>

<p>The vital subject of the housing of the huge masses of the
people of London was, during all the earlier years of this
decade of 1881–90, uppermost in the minds of those who
were solicitous for their welfare.</p>

<p>The Act of 1879 had done but little to help to a solution
of the tremendous problem.</p>

<p>A short experience of it, and of “Cross’s” Housing Act,
had shown that instead of “owners” being visited with
heavy penalties for their iniquities, they were being actually
rewarded. In fact, they secured under these Acts not only
a full, but an inordinately high compensation for their
property—regardless of its infamous condition—and the
ratepayers of London were mulcted in large sums to pay
them for it.</p>

<p>“I desire,” said the Medical Officer of Health for
Hackney in 1883, “to express a very strong opinion that it
is most unfair to the ratepayers that they should be compelled
to pay for uninhabitable property which has been allowed by
the owners to get into a dilapidated state for want of substantial
repairs such as cannot be required under the
Nuisances Removal Acts….”</p>

<p>The first scheme which was initiated by the Metropolitan
Board in 1875 was only completed at a net cost of £151,763,
which sum had to be borne by the ratepayers of London;
though why they should have been made to pay for the
“owners” neglect which had led to the evil conditions of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
his property is not very clear, except that Parliament willed
it so.</p>

<p>By 1882 the total number of insanitary areas dealt with
by the Metropolitan Board, or in process of being dealt with,
was fourteen. The houses in these areas had been inhabited
by 20,335 persons in 5,555 separate holdings, 3,349 of which
consisted of one room only.<a id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>They were acquired by the Board at a cost of £1,661,000.
Parliament had imposed upon the Board the obligation to
provide accommodation for at least as many persons of the
working classes as were displaced by the destruction of the
houses on these areas. As the Board were not empowered
to undertake the building of the houses in which to re-accommodate
the displaced persons, the sites, after having
been cleared, had to be sold to persons or companies, who
were put under the obligation to erect workmen’s dwellings
thereon; but inasmuch as the land had been bought at its
value for commercial purpose, which was far higher than
its value for residential houses, this Parliamentary obligation
entailed upon the Metropolitan Board, and through
them upon the ratepayers of London, an enormous loss.</p>

<p>The Goulston Street scheme in Whitechapel, for instance,
was acquired at a cost of £371,600. When sold, under the
conditions imposed by Parliament, it realised only £87,600;
and the Whitecross Street scheme (in St. Luke’s), which cost
£391,000, when sold realised £76,350.</p>

<p>The whole of the transactions, so far, resulted in a net loss
to the Metropolitan Board, or in other words, a net charge
upon the ratepayers of London of over £1,100,000.</p>

<p>As Mr. Chamberlain described the result, in an article he
contributed to the <cite>Fortnightly Review</cite> of December, <span class="no-break">1883:—</span></p>

<p>“Torrens’ and Cross’ Housing Acts are tainted and
paralysed by the incurable timidity with which Parliament
… is accustomed to deal with the sacred rights of
property….</p>

<p>“The individual wrong-doer is to remain unpunished—retribution
for his sins is to be exacted from the whole
community.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>The enormous cost of carrying the Acts into effect stayed
the hand of the Metropolitan Board, while the length of
time, stretching out into years, required for the various proceedings,
militated against the success of the schemes so far
as providing residences for the displaced people.</p>

<p>An example of the working of the Act was described in
1883 by the Rev. S. A. Barnett.<a id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>“In 1876 the dwellings of 4,000 persons in this parish
(Whitechapel) were condemned as uninhabitable, and the
official scheme for their demolition and reconstruction was
prepared. During the next four years the ‘scheme’ ploughed
its course through arbitration and compensation with a
puzzling slowness.</p>

<p>“It was indeed a ‘killing slowness,’ for, during all those
years, landlords whose claims had been settled spent nothing
on further repairs; tenants, expecting their compensation,
put up with any wretchedness; while the Vestry, looking to
the approaching reconstruction of the houses, let streets and
footways fall to pieces. It was not until 1880 that the
needful demolition was seriously begun. Since that date the
houses of some thousands of the poor have been destroyed.”</p>

<p>And then he described the slowness of the reconstruction,
and <span class="no-break">added:—</span></p>

<p>“Such is the seven years’ history of the Artizans’ Dwellings
Act in a parish under the rule of the Metropolitan
Board of Works.”</p>

<p>He expressed his opinion that the prime source of the evil
was not in the law, but in the local administration; but the
complications of ownership, the endless legal difficulties and
formalities, the numerous arbitrations, necessarily consumed
years of time before the land could be cleared for building,
and then the actual building of the new houses was by no
means rapid.</p>

<p>The mode of procedure was attended with such difficulties
and disadvantages, and the administration of the Acts so
clogged, that a Select Committee of the House of Commons
was appointed and sat in 1881, and again in 1882, to inquire
into the causes of the want of success, and to consider in
what way the law might be further amended so as to make
it really workable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>
<p>The condition imposed as to re-housing, and which was
so rigorously insisted on, did not by any means achieve the
desired result.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Lyulph Stanley<a id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> in 1884: “Not
one single person of all the poor displaced in the carrying
out of the Gray’s Inn Road improvement, powers for which
were obtained in 1877, had been re-housed by the Board.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel, in his
evidence in 1881, also showed that many of those in the
houses which were to be pulled down were not working men
at all.</p>

<p>“Many of the people do not come into the Whitechapel
District for the purpose of getting employment. They have
other motives; they come from all parts of the country; a
great many are tramps, and come up for the purpose of
begging, some for stealing, and some to obtain the advantage
of the charities which exist in London, and many of them to
get out of the way and hide themselves.”</p>

<p>By this time, moreover, the possibilities of getting
accommodation further afield was beginning to come into
view.</p>

<p>“With the facilities for coming by the early trains and
the various tramways that we have now at a cheap rate,
the rents of many of the inhabitants of Whitechapel would
not be increased by moving from it.”</p>

<p>That the obligation to re-house was imposed alone upon
the public authorities and upon railway companies was
rather inequitable. In many districts the destruction of
houses, and the unhousing of the inhabitants, was carried
out on a far larger scale by private owners, and no such
obligation was imposed upon them. The policy, therefore,
was decidedly onesided, and was very costly to the ratepayer
who was in no way responsible for the proceedings of the
private house-owner who had caused all the trouble.</p>

<p>The Committee reported in June, 1882. They expressed
their opinion <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing would contribute more to the social, moral, and
physical improvement of a certain portion of the working
classes than the improvement of the houses and places in
which they live.”</p>

<p>They stated that “very great hardship would often follow
if the provision for the replacement in or near the area of
displacement were wholly done away with.”</p>

<p>“The special calling of many of the work people, the
hours of their work, the employment of their children, the
maintenance of their home life, the economy of living
together in a family, the cheapness of food owing to the
nearness of the great evening markets, &amp;c., render it very
desirable that a large portion should be enabled to re-house
themselves in or near their old houses of living, and if no
fresh dwellings be provided the evils of overcrowding will at
once increase.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Still, it is equally true that these observations do not
apply to the whole population. Many without any special
calling may live in one place as well as another. The
facilities of transit recently offered by cheap trains, by boats,
by tramways, &amp;c., have enabled many to live in the suburbs
who can do so consistently with their calling.”</p>

<p>“Your Committee are of opinion that the existing law,
which requires that the improvement scheme shall provide
for the accommodation of, <em>at the least, as many persons</em> of
the working class as may be displaced, may be relaxed, and
that the accommodation to be required should vary from
half to two-thirds.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact very few, if any, of the families thus
dispossessed returned for the purpose of occupying the new
buildings.</p>

<p>Indeed one witness<a id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> said <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“Neither the Peabody Trustees, nor—more or less—the
other Artizans’ Dwellings Companies would take in the class
of people who had been displaced.”</p>

<p>The Committee called attention to the importance of
favouring in every way facilities of transit between the
metropolis and its suburbs by an extension of cheap workmen’s
trains.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>
<p>And they also recommended <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“All existing sanitary legislation should be more fully
enforced, especially in those parts of the suburbs where
buildings are so rapidly springing up.”</p>

<p>A Bill was at once introduced into Parliament, the object
of which was to lay down such rules for estimating the value
of the premises to be purchased as would prevent the owners
of insanitary property obtaining an undue price for it—“the
intention of Parliament being that the owner should not
gain by having allowed his property to fall into an insanitary
state.”</p>

<p>It was passed, and as an Act it further empowered the
Secretary of State, under certain circumstances, to dispense
with the obligation of re-housing the people to a greater
extent than one-half of those displaced.</p>

<p>Into the detailed intricacies of many of these Housing
Acts it is really useless to enter; and the enumeration of
the details tends to obscure the broad and essential features
of the whole subject.</p>

<p>In the effort of the “owners” to repudiate the responsibility
for their or their predecessors’ infamous neglect, and
to shift the blame for the appalling state of affairs on the
middlemen and the occupiers; in the effort of the middlemen
to evade their responsibilities by availing themselves of every
obstructive device the law so lavishly placed at their disposal,
and of both of them to extort the utmost amount of money
they could for their disease-begetting, death-distributing
property; the unfortunate occupiers were the immediate
sufferers and victims, and a huge wrong and injury was
inflicted upon the community.</p>

<p>It was mere tinkering with the subject to pass an Act
removing some petty technical difficulties for putting some
previous and very limited Act in force, and to diminish the
expense and delay in carrying out the Act.</p>

<p>It was farcical to amend the Standing Orders of Parliament,
fixing twenty instead of fifteen as the minimum number of
houses in any one parish which could be acquired by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Metropolitan Board without preparing a re-housing scheme,
as if that would revolutionise the condition of the housing
of the people of London, and yet something not far short of
revolution was required if the housing of the people was to
be reformed, and put on a proper sanitary basis.</p>

<p>It is manifest that what was being dealt with by these
Acts was only a fragment of the great housing question, and
that such destruction of insanitary buildings as could
possibly be effected by these means would amount to but a
fraction of those unfit for human habitation in London, and
would not touch the thousands of inhabited houses in every
parish of London which were insanitary in varying degree,
and dangerous to the individual and public health. It is
clear, too, that if the insanitary conditions of the housing
of the people were to be dealt with on a large scale, and with
success, measures must be taken to secure the sanitary condition
of the houses which such legislation did not touch.
Otherwise general improvement was impossible, and existing
conditions must continue indefinitely to flourish, and to produce
their inevitable and enormous crop of deadly evil.</p>

<p>How urgent was the need for reform in some parts of
London may be gauged from the description of the condition
of things in Bethnal Green in 1883, given by the Medical
Officer of Health of the <span class="no-break">Parish:—</span></p>

<p>“The portions of the district I have examined include
nearly 2,000 houses.</p>

<p>“I have visited and carefully examined almost every one of
these houses, and I must confess that a condition of things
has been thereby revealed to me of which I had no previous
conception, for I do not think I visited a single house
without finding some grave sanitary defect; in a very large
number the walls of the staircases, passages, and rooms
are black with filth, the ceilings are rotten and bulging, the
walls damp and decayed, the roofs defective, and the ventilation
and lighting most imperfect.</p>

<p>“The dampness of the walls is in some instances due to
defects in the roof, but in many the moisture rises from the
earth owing to the walls being constructed without any
damp-proof course….</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“In almost every house I visited I found the yard, paving,
and surface drainage, in a more or less defective condition,
a quantity of black fœtid mud having accumulated in
places.”</p>

<p>And all this was nearly thirty years after Bethnal Green
had been endowed with a local sanitary authority.</p>

<p>Returns given occasionally by the Medical Officers of
Health revealed the appalling state of insanitation in which
people still lived; streets where in nearly every house
nuisances dangerous to health were found to exist; a
“Place” in St. Pancras where the death-rate in 1881 had
been 57 per 1,000, or 2½ times as much as that for London;
a “Place” in St. Marylebone with 22 six-roomed houses,
where the births were less in number than the deaths,
and the existing population were extinguishing themselves.
And overcrowding had increased in many parts of the
metropolis, and some of the Medical Officers of Health had
come to regard it as inevitable and impossible to prevent.</p>

<p>The reports of the Select Committees of 1881 and 1882,
and the outbreak of cholera in Egypt in 1883 which
awakened apprehensions of its spread to England, quickened
public interest in the sanitary condition of the metropolis,
evoked a stronger expression of public opinion upon the
existing evils, stirred up lethargic Vestries and District
Boards to some special show of activity, and awakened the
Local Government Board, and brought it into the field as
an active inciter of the local sanitary authorities to adequate
efforts to improve the sanitary condition of the people,
and to grapple with the terrible problems of insanitary
dwellings, of overcrowding, and the consequent physical
misery and degradation of hundreds of thousands of the
people.</p>

<p>The position of affairs had become clearer than it had
ever been before, and its magnitude and importance was
beginning to be appreciated, and the iniquities which were
being allowed, and the evils which were tolerated, were
coming more into the light of day and were being better
understood and realised. Though in many ways there had
been progress and improvement, yet in many others, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
most vital consequence, it was evident things were scarcely
moving at all.</p>

<p>It was now manifest that at the rate the demolition of
slums and the re-housing of the people could be carried out,
a very great length of time must elapse; so great that the
remedy must be of the slowest, whilst, by itself, it would be
wholly inadequate; and it was beginning to be realised that
many of the local authorities, instead of administering the
laws they were charged by Parliament to administer, were
even obstructing and opposing sanitary reforms.</p>

<p>Once again the alarm of cholera woke up the Vestries,
and some of the recorded results of such wakening are an
illuminating exposure of the normal state of inaction on
their part, and of the chronic insanitary condition of their
parishes not revealed at other times.</p>

<p>In <span class="no-break">Westminster:—</span></p>

<p>“In anticipation of cholera a thorough inspection by a
house-to-house visitation through the whole of the united
parishes has been undertaken. Naturally many defects
were found, and directions given as to what was required.
The work has been completed and I consider that the
parishes are now in a very satisfactory condition.”</p>

<p>In Poplar, 2,114 houses were inspected, of which only 334
were found to be in good order.</p>

<p>In Lambeth, six men were engaged temporarily for the
purpose of a special inspection.</p>

<p>“11,493 houses were visited; 5,594 required sanitary
improvements…. In many houses several defects were
reported, bringing up the total of sanitary improvements to
12,014.”</p>

<p>In Bermondsey, no fewer than 5,992 notices were issued
for the execution of sanitary works which were required.</p>

<p>The Sanitary Act of 1866 had enacted <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“It shall be the duty of the Nuisance Authority to make,
from time to time, either by itself or its officers, inspection
of the district with a view to ascertain what nuisances exist
calling for abatement under the powers of the Nuisances
Removal Acts, and to enforce the provisions of the said Acts
in order to cause the abatement thereof.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>But by many Vestries the duty had been either entirely
neglected or very imperfectly performed.</p>

<p>The Medical Officers of Health were unceasing in pressing
upon their employers the necessity of inspection.</p>

<p>“It is only by the constant inspection and re-inspection
of property inhabited by tenants of this class (tenement-houses)
that the houses can be kept in decent sanitary
condition,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for Bethnal
Green.</p>

<p>“My opinion of the value of regular house-to-house
inspection throughout the year,” wrote the Medical Officer
of Health for Poplar, “is more confirmed than ever, and
that such is needed for the proper sanitary supervision of
the district.”</p>

<p>“It is by constant inspection,” wrote another Medical
Officer of Health, “that the Vestry can best do its duty in
preserving the lives and health of its parishioners.”</p>

<p>“Facts are stubborn things,” wrote the Medical Officer of
Health for St. Mary, Newington, after 28 years’ sanitary
work himself, “and they clearly demonstrate the necessity
for a continual supervision of the dwellings of the poor
(more especially) and for as constant an attack on all
removable insanitary conditions. This after all is the
real work to be done.”</p>

<p>But the Vestries and District Boards paid little heed to
this advice.</p>

<p>Naturally, inspection was not welcome to sanitary
defaulters or misdoers; naturally, the light of the sanitary
policeman’s lantern into the dark places of slum-owners and
‘house-knackers’ was resented. It was an invasion of the
rights of property, of the privacy of an Englishman’s home,
even if he did not live in that home himself, but let it to
somebody else to live in. “Why should not a man do as
he liked with his own?”</p>

<p>And so, as inspection was, from the house “owners’”
point of view, an unpopular thing, too much money was not
spent by Vestries upon Sanitary Inspectors’ salaries, and
even in the best inspected parishes or districts the portion
inspected was small indeed compared with the whole of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
parish or district. How much was left undone, and left
undone for years, was proved over and over again by whole
areas being represented by their Medical Officers of Health
as insanitary, or by their having to shut up houses as unfit
for human habitation.</p>

<p>The attempt made by Parliament in 1866—in the scheme
embodied in the 35th Section of the Sanitary Act—to
provide a remedy for overcrowding, and to secure the
maintenance of a moderate standard of cleanliness and
sanitation in the tenement-houses, had been an excellent
one; and Parliament improved the scheme in 1874 by
extending its scope. Almost the whole of the existing evils
lay in these tenement-houses, for it was there where the
great mass of the disease, filth, and misery of London was
to be found, and there where the greatest overcrowding,
and the deepest moral and physical degradation existed.</p>

<p>But with the few exceptions already described practically
no use had been made of the powers.</p>

<p>“Vested rights in filth and dirt” had still too large a
representation upon, and too powerful a grip of the local
sanitary authorities for any action to be adopted which
would entail trouble upon the possessors of those rights.</p>

<p>Some Vestries, for form’s sake, had made regulations
but never put them in force. A few had tentatively put
them in force, and promptly dropped them. A large
proportion of them did not take even that much trouble, but
simply ignored them altogether; and so, some seventeen
years after the Act was passed, the whole scheme had ceased
to be operative, and was in complete abeyance.</p>

<p>In December, 1883, the Local Government Board, having
realised the gravity of the situation, endeavoured to get the
Vestries and District Boards to take action, but the Local
Government Board could not compel them to make such
regulations, as there was no power of compulsion, and there
was no penalty for refusal to enforce or even to make them.<a id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>The Vestries and District Boards were, in fact, masters of
the situation, and could act or not act, just as they pleased—and
most of them did not act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Various were the excuses made by the Vestries for doing
nothing.</p>

<p>The feeling which prevailed in the Vestry of Clerkenwell
was <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“The regulations generally were of such an inquisitorial
and troublesome character that they were unsuited to an
Englishman’s home. For instance, it was shown that in
some cases even clergymen occupied lodgings which would
be reached by these regulations.”</p>

<p>And yet there were 4,700 houses in the parish to which
such regulations would have been applicable, and where
their application would have been of the utmost benefit to
thousands of families. And from 1866 up to 1884 this power
might have been, but was not used.</p>

<p>The Vestry of Bethnal Green <span class="no-break">was—</span></p>

<p>“Unanimously of opinion that it was unnecessary to
make the regulations, and considered the existing powers
sufficient.”</p>

<p>The Vestry of St. George-in-the-East <span class="no-break">resolved—</span></p>

<p>“That whilst fully recognising the necessity of continuing
to carry out with vigour the general sanitary laws, the Vestry
did not consider it advisable in the present depressed condition
of trade in the parish to incur the additional expense of
enforcing special sanitary regulations for houses let in
lodgings” (estimated to number above 4,000).</p>

<p>In Westminster, the District Board resolved that no
further steps should be taken as regarded making or enforcing
regulations, as the <span class="no-break">Board—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“Already possessed ample powers under existing statutes
to enable it to deal promptly and effectively with such
sanitary defects as the proposed regulations are intended to
remedy”—a contention which, if true, threw discredit upon
themselves, as there were thousands of filthy and insanitary
abodes in that district which were not dealt with at all.</p>

<p>St. Pancras Vestry refused (1883) to make regulations,
though its Medical Officer of Health had made more than
one appeal to them to do so.</p>

<p>“I would beg to remind the Vestry that until proper regulations
are made and enforced in St. Pancras for this class
of houses, the Vestry have not exercised to their full extent
the powers they possess for improving the condition of their
poorer parishioners, and that the moral and physical welfare
of those who are least able to help themselves is a question
which concerns the Vestry as much, if not more, than any
other it is their duty to consider.”</p>

<p>And in the following year he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Upon the Metropolitan Sanitary Authorities rests a great
responsibility, for it is absolutely within their power to insist
upon all dwelling-houses being maintained in condition fit
for human habitation, and they may, within limits, prevent
overcrowding, which is no less disastrous to health than to
morality.</p>

<p>“I have repeatedly recommended the Vestry to adopt
regulations for houses let in lodgings, and have pointed out
the power they would then possess for ensuring tenemented
houses being maintained in proper sanitary condition. I
would desire, in my last report, to urge upon them the
further consideration of this subject.”</p>

<p>There were doubtless difficulties in putting regulations
such as these in operation—as, indeed, there are in putting
all laws in operation—but two Vestries had put them most
successfully in operation, and therefore the difficulties were
not so great as those who were opposed to them insisted.</p>

<p>Some of the Vestries stated that they could equally well
attain the same results under the powers of the Nuisances
Removal Acts; but that was not the fact, for there were many
and considerable advantages in this form of procedure over
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the procedure prescribed in other Acts relating to health
and sanitation. Indeed, the Medical Officer of Health for
Fulham declared (in 1884) <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“This section gave almost all the legal power that could
be wished for to place the dwellings of the poor in a proper
sanitary condition.”</p>

<p>And in the following year he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“It will therefore in future be the fault of the Sanitary
Authority if the dwellings of the poor are not kept as they
should be.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Camberwell, discussing
the general aspect of the matter, wrote <span class="no-break">(1884):—</span></p>

<p>“I cannot help remarking on the feebleness which constantly
spoils the best intentioned sanitary legislation, and
which is conspicuous in the enactments relating to houses
let in lodgings.</p>

<p>“The Local Government Board have declared that certain
enactments are in force, but they cannot compel the Vestries
to frame any regulations of their own, nor even can they
compel Vestries to carry out and enforce regulations which
the Vestries have framed and the Board have sanctioned.</p>

<p>“Now I am one of those who think that by the judicious
regulation of lodging-houses of certain kinds, and in certain
localities, very much good might be effected, and much
advantage would accrue both to the lodgers and to the
public. But it is clear that it ought never to have been left
to individual Vestries in a place like London, to adopt or not
to adopt, the enactments referred to, simply according to
their pleasure, still more that they should never have been
allowed to frame inconsistent orders or regulations….</p>

<p>“The opportunity (of the Act of 1874) might have been
seized, not for giving an empty power to the Local Government
Board, but for requiring the Metropolitan Board of
Works to frame suitable regulations for the whole of the
metropolis, which the Vestries might have been required to
enforce as they are required to enforce other provisions of
the Sanitary Acts.”</p>

<p>A similar opinion was expressed by the District Board of
St. Olave, Southwark, which, after stating that it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
one of the first to make regulations, it had been found unnecessary
or impracticable to enforce them, went on to
<span class="no-break">say:—</span></p>

<p>“The fact of the enactment having been practically inoperative
throughout the metropolis, … it was considered
that it would be unjust to enforce stringent regulations in
the district, while in other parts of the metropolis regulations
might differ in principle, and be neglected in practice: and
what the Board wanted to see was a system of sanitary
regulations which should be strictly uniform throughout
the metropolis, and in which there should be no option on
the part of local authorities of enforcing or neglecting.”</p>

<p>The explanation of this general inaction was the simple
and obvious one that on those bodies there were many whose
interests ran counter to the adoption of the Act, and what
its adoption entailed; the sanitary obligations, the annual
lime-washings, &amp;c., would entail expense; they were not
going to inflict the cost upon themselves or upon their
friends if they could avoid doing so. And as they could
avoid it, the great bulk of the local authorities deliberately
ignored the remedy devised by Parliament, and with most
reprehensible callousness let the evils go on and increase.
But while they remained inactive, death and disease did
not.</p>

<p>Progress in sanitation was retarded also somewhat by
other circumstances.</p>

<p>The Medical Officers of Health were under no obligation
to reside in their district, and were at liberty to take private
practice, and so the whole of their time was not given to
their public duty.<a id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>But furthermore, they were in a state of dependence on
their employers, which naturally would often prevent their
reporting fully upon sanitary matters, though, happily,
there appear to have been few who were influenced by this
consideration. And some of the Vestries and District
Boards did not hesitate to put pressure upon their Medical
Officers to prevent energy on their part. It was stated in
evidence before the Select Committee in 1882 that a
Medical Officer would very soon “bring a hornet’s nest
round his ears if he attempted to do his duty strictly and
independently.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Shaftesbury declared, in 1884,<a id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> that he was quite
certain <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“They would never have the laws of health properly
given effect to, until they asserted the independence of the
Health Officers.”</p>

<p>Nor were the Sanitary Inspectors as efficient as they
might have been, though there had been a great improvement
in the class of man appointed.</p>

<p>The Chief Sanitary Inspector for Clerkenwell<a id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> <span class="no-break">reported:—</span></p>

<p>“The two men (in Clerkenwell) are not very active. It
is the greatest trouble I have to get the men to do their
duty.”</p>

<p>“The Sanitary Inspectors have not always shown as
much zeal and interest as they might have done, but lately
they have improved…. It is openly talked about in a
good many districts in London that a system of bribing
goes on.”<a id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>But those who were energetic were also discouraged by
the same pressure which damped some of the energies of
the Medical Officers of Health.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Fulham wrote,
in <span class="no-break">1884:—</span></p>

<p>“So many are the vested interests that Sanitary Officers
are obliged in the performance of their duty to interfere
with, that they must be prepared to meet with injustice and
opposition in almost all directions. It is not at all
surprising that the dwellings of the poor in London should
be in an insanitary condition seeing the great obstacles
public sanitary officers have in the performance of their
duties.”</p>

<p>And yet there were many who did their work well, and
who did much to improve the conditions of living of those
who were under their care or charge; and did it in the face
of many obstacles and much discouragement, and of all the
opposition that vested interests could bring to bear against
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of the Vestries and District Boards were not only
not above reproach, but were strongly to be condemned.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Dilke, then President of the Local Government
Board, speaking in 1883, <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“There were some parishes in London which had very
zealously tried to work the existing law, but, on the other
hand, there were more parishes the government of which
was a flagrant scandal.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Chamberlain, in an article in the <cite>Fortnightly
Review</cite> of December, 1883, <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“In the metropolis, where the evil is greatest, the want
of an efficient and thoroughly representative municipal
government stands in the way of reform.</p>

<p>“The Vestries, often in the hands of cliques and chosen
at elections which excite no public interest, are largely
composed of small house-property owners, who cannot be
expected to be enthusiastic in putting the law in force
against themselves.”</p>

<p>And in the House of Commons, on the 4th of March,
1884, Sir Charles Dilke stated <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“In Clerkenwell, the two joint dictators of the parish,
who had control of the Vestry and its leading Committee,
one of them being Chairman of the principal Committee,
were the largest owners in the whole district of Clerkenwell
of bad or doubtful property…. In Clerkenwell there were
fourteen house-farmers on the Vestry and twelve publicans
who seemed to work very much with them.”</p>

<p>Nothing more decisively demonstrates the hostility of the
Vestries to the Act of 1866, indeed to all this branch of
sanitary reform, than the fact that they would not make
adequate provision for the performance of the sanitary
duties imposed on them by divers Acts of Parliament.</p>

<p>A return compiled by the Medical Officer of Health for
Bethnal Green in 1885, from information supplied him by
the Medical Officers of Health of thirty-eight Vestries,
shows how the local sanitary authorities crippled sanitary
work by a wholly inadequate staff of Inspectors.</p>

<p class="p1">In the whole of the metropolis there were 103 Inspectors
of Nuisances—a rough average of one Inspector to about
40,000 of the population.</p>

<p>How could it be expected that one Inspector could look
after a town of 40,000 people?</p>

<p>Consistently, and, year after year, insistently, did the
bulk of the Medical Officers of Health complain of the lack
of sufficient Sanitary Inspectors, and point out the necessity
for more Sanitary Inspectors; some begged for them—but
to nearly all these appeals the Vestries turned a deaf ear.</p>

<p>Every now and then some incident occurred or some
exposure was made of some abominations of insanitation
which were a revelation of the extraordinary methods
adopted by some men in utilising land for building houses
regardless of all sanitary consequences whatever to others.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Times</cite> of December 18, 1883, an article was
published entitled “A Curious Site for Industrial Dwellings.”</p>

<p>“The things which are done in London under the shadow
of legal right are sometimes startling.”</p>

<p>In Bethnal Green were two disused burial-grounds—“Globe
Fields” and “Peel Grove.” Parliament authorised
a railway line to be constructed through “Globe Fields.”</p>

<p>Foundations had to be made for the arches, and trenches
had to be dug in the burial-ground.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health, on inspecting the place,
found a horrible condition of things. But with many
precautions against loosing some virulent epidemic in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
locality, the human remains were removed and re-interred
elsewhere, and, it is stated, part of the ground was built
over.</p>

<p>Fuller particulars were given as to the Peel Grove
Cemetery. The ground, several acres in extent, had been
leased by a pawnbroker and started as a cemetery as a
speculation. The statements made by the writer in the
<cite>Times</cite> are specially illuminating. The cemetery was
opened about 1840 without consecration. The Bishop
refused to consecrate the ground as burials had taken place
in it already, and as some difficulties were consequently
experienced, the speculating pawnbroker acted, it is said,
for some years as chaplain.</p>

<p>Ultimately, somehow or other, a chaplain was appointed.</p>

<p>About 20,000 persons had been buried in it, six deep, and
packed as closely as it was possible to pack them—not even
earth between the coffins, so anxious was the owner to
economise space; large numbers who died of cholera in
1849 having been buried there.</p>

<p>The last interment took place in September, 1855.</p>

<p>In 1883, the ground having served one financial purpose,
it became desirable to utilise it for another financial
purpose, and the proposal was made to erect houses upon it,
and an agreement was entered into with a builder for the
erection of blocks of dwellings thereon. This builder
commenced excavations for the purpose of laying foundations,
and he had sent in drainage plans for a block of
industrial dwellings to the Vestry of Bethnal Green.</p>

<p>“Is such an obvious violation of the laws of health and
decency to be permitted?” said the writer.</p>

<p>“The Vestry are alive to the situation, and appear to be
willing to do all in their power to avert the catastrophe.
But the law on the subject is by no means clear…. It
is little short of scandalous that such doubts should
exist. It is repugnant to every feeling of decency and
propriety to invite human beings to live in densely packed
crowds over a charnel-house.”</p>

<p>The sanitary condition of any city or district must, as
has already been pointed out, depend very largely upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
the system of local government in existence at the time,
and its efficiency or inefficiency.</p>

<p>This was specially true of this great metropolis with its
millions of people, its vast extent, its great diversities.</p>

<p>To all intents and purposes the main features of the local
government of London had undergone little change since
1855. There was still the “City” with its special law,
special area, and special government, to which had been
added the Port Sanitary Authority.</p>

<p>And there was the Central Authority, the Metropolitan
Board of Works; and there were the local sanitary authorities,
the Vestries and District Boards—and to them had been
added the Metropolitan Asylums Board, another indirectly
elected central body. But there were very manifest and
prominent defects of the very gravest nature in this system
of London government, and in 1884 the Government of the
day made an effort to construct a better system.</p>

<p>Sir William Harcourt introduced the London Government
Bill into the House of Commons.</p>

<p>“While London grew,” he said,<a id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> “the Corporation
remained stationary.”</p>

<p>“The central body must deal with the large affairs, … a
central body doing all the great things.”</p>

<p>“The central principle of the Bill is this, that there
should be some common control over the Vestries which
shall give them a uniform action for the benefit of the
whole community instead of leaving them as they now are,
independent of any such control.”</p>

<p>“What is the great evil? It is that the metropolis is
broken up into fragments acting on a different principle,
some doing ill, and those who do well suffering in consequence
of the ill-doings of their neighbours.”</p>

<p>“When the danger (of invasion of cholera) threatens a
great metropolis like London, all must desire and want a
central authority which should advise, which should assist,
which should compel every part of the community to take
those measures of precaution which are necessary for the
safety of the whole. No such authority exists at this time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>
<p>“If a Vestry refuses to make sanitary bye-laws, or to carry
out a proper system of sanitary inspection, you are absolutely
powerless to compel them to do so. A single parish may
become a plague-spot in London from which disease may be
spread all around, and the Metropolitan Authority have no
authority to make the parish do as it ought to do.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone said<a id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a><span class="no-break">:—</span></p>

<p>“The local government of London is, or, if it is not, it
certainly ought to be, the crown of all our local and
municipal institutions.</p>

<p>“The principle of unity (of London) has already been
established under the pressure of necessity as a matter
which could not be resisted. It has been established in
the Metropolitan Board of Works…. There can be no
doubt we have established a principle of unity, and that
we have found it satisfactory.</p>

<p>“The supply of water and the supply of gas … two
of the most elementary among the purposes of municipal
government, have been handed over to private Corporations
for the purpose of private profit because you have not chosen
to create a complete municipality for the metropolis.</p>

<p>“And that is not all.</p>

<p>“The defects of the present system are admitted….
Surely if there are these great and intolerable defects they
ought to be remedied by the action of some genuine popular
local authority. But we have got no genuine popular
local authority….</p>

<p>“London, large as it is, is a natural unit—united by
common features, united by common approximation, by
common neighbourhood, by common dangers—depending
upon common supplies, having common wants and common
conveniences.</p>

<p>“… Unity of Government in the metropolis is the only
method on which we can proceed for producing municipal
reform.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>
<p>The Bill was strongly opposed in Parliament, and was
withdrawn at a late period of the Session, “but its introduction
and discussion had done much to awaken interest
and mature opinion on the question of the practicability of
the government of London by a single municipality.”<a id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Up to this time, though overcrowding had occupied so
prominent a position in the great health problem of London,
no returns of the amount of overcrowding actually existing
had been obtained, nor had any estimate even been attempted.
The reports of the Medical Officers of Health showed in
many graphic descriptions that overcrowding was prevalent
in every part of London—more acutely so in some districts
than in others—but as to the amount no information was
available.</p>

<p>The first reliable figures over a large area—a large central
district of London—were collected by Mr. T. Marchant
Williams, Inspector of Schools for the London School
Board, and published in the <cite>Times</cite> of February 22, 1884.</p>

<p>He wrote giving some of the results of his recent investigations
into the social conditions of the people residing in
his district.</p>

<p>“My sole desire,” he wrote, “is to record facts. It will
be my endeavour to show that these facts are sufficiently
typical or representative of the social condition of the
elementary school population of London to serve as a
trustworthy basis for a fairly accurate estimate of the
stupendous difficulties the School Board for London has to
contend with.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <cite>Times</cite> commented, in a leading article, on this
information.</p>

<p>“Everywhere, and by all sections not immediately
affected, the scandal and almost the absurdity of the brutish
degradation of an enormous number of habitations in the
greatest and most opulent city in the world are thoroughly
recognised…. Habits of life such as lodgings of the kind
now common among London workmen foster and encourage
are a positive danger to the whole of society. Only by one
rank is the question treated as of no pressing importance.
That happens to be the body of persons directly interested.</p>

<p>“… No more instructive contribution has been offered
towards a clear perception of the dimensions of the problem
than those given by Mr. Marchant Williams….</p>

<p>“Incidentally the census, by the School Board, of the
classes it was founded to teach, contains the precise
materials for informing the public of the extent of the
overcrowding which has been shocking the moral sense of
the nation. Formerly, when instances of overcrowding
were cited, it might have been fancied they were exceptions
or exaggerations. Mr. Williams’ report allows of no possibility
of a doubt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The Finsbury educational division contained, in 1881, a
population of 503,851. Of these, 41,044 live in single
rooms, at an average rate of four a room; 82,215 occupy
suites of two rooms, at a rate exceeding four persons and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
three-quarters for each. For a family of two to monopolise
a whole room is a luxury, and to possess two rooms is a
marvel. Some rooms are made to hold ten, and many to
hold six or seven….</p>

<p>“A home partakes of the life of the dwellers in it. They
mould and incorporate it with their being, and it helps to
mould and fashion them. The 123,000 owners of an undivided
and indivisible quarter of a hovel in Finsbury, and
the other hundreds of thousands in like case elsewhere in
the town, are curtailed of the essential parts of the rights
of humanity by the miserable accident that their locality
refuses them reasonable standing room. Family life is
an impossibility for a whole family collected in the single
room 12 to 15 feet by 6 to 10. In a multitude of instances
those tenanting a single room are several families, not one.
They have to distribute the floor by square inches, and
grow up with less regard to decency than a cat or a dog.”</p>

<p>And in another letter written a few days later, Mr.
Marchant Williams <span class="no-break">added:—</span></p>

<p>“It was only the other day that I discovered in one
of these streets (near Fitzroy Square) a house containing
nine rooms, each of which accommodates on an average
eight persons!</p>

<p>“… The rents in the most crowded parts of my district
amount as a rule to about a third or fourth of the maximum
wages earned by the tenants.”</p>

<p>He mentions a case, a <span class="no-break">riveter:—</span></p>

<p>“He had recently abandoned the room in which he, his
wife, and six children had lived for two years.”</p>

<p>“I have more than once when going my rounds been
accosted by a landlord in a state of abject terror, lest I
might be arranging to rob him of some of his victims. The
landlord’s defence invariably is that he is obliged to levy
high rents because the tenants frequently run away by
night and leave no trace behind them of their whereabouts.”</p>

<p>More and more did the feeling grow that something must
be done to ameliorate the conditions under which the
working classes and poorer people were living, and on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the 22nd of February, the Marquess of Salisbury, in the
House of Lords, moved in an Address to Her Majesty
for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into
the housing of the working classes.<a id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>“The attention of persons of every class, of every creed,
and school of politics, has been turned to this question,”
he said.</p>

<p>H.R.H. the Prince of Wales <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“I feel convinced that your lordships, in common with
all classes of Her Majesty’s subjects, will be gratified to
learn that the noble Marquess has asked for a searching
inquiry into this great and momentous question with
regard to the housing and the amelioration of the dwellings
of the poor and of the working classes, and that Her
Majesty’s Government have decided to issue a Royal Commission
for that purpose.</p>

<p>“As your Lordships know I take the keenest and liveliest
interest in this question.</p>

<p>“I can assure you, my Lords, that I am deeply flattered
at having been appointed a member of this Royal Commission.”</p>

<p>The Government accepted the motion, and a Royal
Commission was forthwith appointed and immediately
began its work.</p>

<p>While the great question of housing and overcrowding
was under discussion and was being investigated,
and efforts being made to deal with it, various
other matters forming part of the general sanitary
evolution of London were attracting attention, or gradually
developing.</p>

<p>In October, 1882, the limits of the Port of London were
extended seawards, and in the following year the powers
of the Port Sanitary Authority were extended.<a id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Most
of the powers of an Urban Sanitary Authority under the
Public Health Act of 1875 were conferred upon it, and
the Medical Officer of Health reported that he believed
the legal powers of the Authority would be found “amply
sufficient for the sanitary control and supervision of
the Port.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>The Authority extended its attention now to the inspection
of imported meat. It was a matter of the first
importance to watch carefully the food supply of the people.
The trade of frozen meat had been rapidly growing, and
from time to time large quantities arrived in unsound
condition, which it was most necessary should be prevented
going on to the market.</p>

<p>In connection with another very important article of food—namely,
milk—action was also taken.</p>

<p>The effect of the order made in 1879 by the Privy
Council, as to dairies, cowsheds, and milkshops, had been
very beneficial, and a marked change for the better in the
conditions under which the milk trade was conducted was
the result. That Order was revoked in 1885 by the Privy
Council, and a new one passed extending the powers of local
authorities in the matter, and prescribing further precautions
to secure the sanitary condition of all dairies and
cowsheds, and for the protection of milk against infection
or contamination.</p>

<p>Another beneficial sanitary improvement was effected
in 1883, by the extension of the benefits of the infectious
hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board.</p>

<p>The Royal Commission on Fever and Smallpox Hospitals,
in 1882, stated that in their opinion it was of paramount
importance that the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums
Board, to which so many classes of persons might become
liable to be removed, should be made as little unattractive
as the nature of the case admitted, and they considered
that the pauper character which attached to the hospitals
of the Board, and which rendered them repulsive to all but
the indigent, would disappear if the distinction between
paupers and non-paupers were abolished.</p>

<p>This suggestion was partially given effect to by the
Diseases Prevention (Metropolis) Act of 1883, which enacted
that, subject to certain arrangements, the admission
of any person suffering from infectious disease into any
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
hospital provided by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, or
the maintenance of any such person therein, should not
be considered to be parochial relief.</p>

<p>The plan was only partly successful, but as years went
on the hospitals were increasingly used by persons other
than those of the legally recognised pauper class.</p>

<p>In the years 1884 and 1885 the hospitals demonstrated
their great utility. There was a severe epidemic of smallpox.
From its outbreak in 1884, to its subsidence in the
autumn of 1885, no less a number than 12,425 patients
passed through the hospitals, hospital ships, and camps
of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the arrangements
for the removal to hospital of cases of infectious disease,
from the whole of the metropolis, worked smoothly and
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The gain to the community in thus removing infectious
cases from its midst was immeasurable.<a id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>In 1885 the Report of the Royal Commission which had
been inquiring into the Housing of the Working Classes
was published. It presented to the general public a mass of
facts of which previously they had taken but little heed,
and the vast importance of which they had utterly failed
to realise; and it brought into the forefront of social
questions the vital question of the public health, and
the imperative necessity of remedying evils which were
eating into the very vitals of the community.</p>

<p>The Royal Commissioners depicted the widely prevalent
and dreadful overcrowding which existed, and which in
certain localities was becoming more serious than ever,
and they gave numerous instances of it. They described
the fearsome condition of tenement-houses, and of the
people living therein—the inadequacy of the water supply—the
defective sanitary accommodation in houses—the
lack of air space—the absence of ventilation—the use of
cellars and underground rooms as dwelling-places—the
limitless filth.</p>

<p>And they pointed out the dreadful results of this condition
of things—physical, moral, and material—the prevalence
of disease, the heavy death-rate, the destruction
of bodily health, the dreadful immorality resulting from
overcrowding, the degradation to which masses were
doomed, the incitement to drink, and depravity, and crime.
They declared that<span class="no-break">:—</span></p>

<p>“Even statistics of actual disease consequent on overcrowding
would not convey the whole truth as to the loss
of health caused by it to the labouring classes….</p>

<p>“Nothing stronger could be said in describing the effect
of overcrowding than that it is even more destructive to
general health than conducive to the spread of epidemic
and contagious diseases.”</p>

<p>And they pointed out that there was much legislation
designed to meet these evils, yet that the existing laws were
not put in force, some of them having remained a dead
letter from the date when they first found place in the
statute book.</p>

<p>And they investigated the causes of many of these things—and
they assigned the blame for some of them—and they
passed in review the conduct of the local governing
authorities—and they recapitulated the existing laws upon
these various matters, and suggested certain alterations, and
made various valuable recommendations.</p>

<p>There was, in fact, placed on record a calm, unimpassioned,
and unexaggerated statement of the evils which
masses of the population of the great capital were enduring
in the last quarter of the highly civilised and enlightened
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>It was a thorough confirmation of all the reports of the
Medical Officers of Health, and of the facts set out, and
pressed by them, year after year, upon the attention of the
Vestries and District Boards, and which had so persistently
been ignored by so many of those authorities.</p>

<p>The Commissioners classified <span class="no-break">the—</span></p>

<p>“Unquestioned causes which produced the overcrowding
and the generally lamentable condition of the homes of the
labouring classes.”</p>

<p>The first <span class="no-break">was—</span></p>

<p>“The poverty of the inhabitants of the poorest quarters,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
or in other words the relation borne by the wages they
received to the rent they had to pay.”</p>

<p>The next was the demolition, for various reasons, of
houses inhabited by the working classes and poorer people,
and the consequent displacement of the people.</p>

<p>The third was the relation between the owners of
property upon which the dwellings of the poor stood, and
the tenants of those dwellings.</p>

<p>“The other great remaining cause of the evil was the
remissness of local authorities.”</p>

<p>From their very origin, these “authorities” were unsatisfactory
instruments for the performance of the public
duties.</p>

<p>“But little interest was, as a rule, taken in the election
of vestrymen by the inhabitants,” instances having been
known of vestrymen in populous parishes being returned
by two votes, on a show of hands.</p>

<p>Elsewhere it is reported they elected each other.</p>

<p>The Commissioners referred to the “supineness” of
many of these metropolitan local authorities in sanitary
matters, and to the “laxity of administration of some
of them.” And still worse, to the self-interested action
of vestrymen.</p>

<p>Thus on the Vestry of Clerkenwell, they said, <span class="no-break">were—</span></p>

<p>“Thirteen or fourteen persons who are interested in bad
or doubtful property, including several ‘middlemen’; and
ten publicans who, with the exception of one or two, had
the reputation of working with the party who trade in
insanitary property; and accordingly this party commands
a working majority on the Vestry.”</p>

<p>“It is not surprising to find that the Sanitary Inspectors
whose tenure of office and salary is subject to such a body
should show indisposition to activity.”</p>

<p>“The state of the homes of the working classes in
Clerkenwell, the overcrowding, and other evils, which
act and react on one another, must be attributed in a
large measure to the default of the responsible local
authority.”</p>

<p>“Clerkenwell does not stand alone: from various parts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
of London the same complaints are heard of insanitary
property being owned by members of the Vestries and
District Boards, and of sanitary inspection being inefficiently
done, because many of the persons whose duty it
is to see that a better state of things should exist, are
those who are interested in keeping things as they are.”</p>

<p>And in another part of their report they <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“It is evident that the remedies which legislation has
provided for sanitary evils have been imperfectly applied in
the metropolis, and that this failure has been due to
negligence in many cases of the existing local authorities.”</p>

<p>The part of the evidence which was of greatest value
and interest was that which laid bare the responsibility
for the dreadful conditions under which such masses of
the people lived.</p>

<p>Apart from the measure of responsibility which fell on
Parliament itself, and it was no light one, it is clear that
those conditions were due (1) in part to the various classes of
“owners,” (2) in part to the people themselves, and (3)
in part to the local authorities.</p>

<p>As regarded <em>owners</em>, there were first the ground landlords,
who themselves, or whose predecessors had leased their
land for building purposes, or with houses thereon to a
tenant.</p>

<p>It would appear clear that these ground landlords or
freeholders, or lessors, had power to enforce against the
person who held directly from them the repairing clauses
of leases. But the existing condition of things showed that
they did not do so.</p>

<p>One of the witnesses, giving evidence about a particular
property, <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“By the terms of even the old leases the tenant was
supposed to keep the place in proper repair…. The
property has gradually deteriorated in consequence of
neglect.”</p>

<p>And Lord Salisbury, who <span class="no-break">asked:—</span></p>

<p>“I suppose it is practically impossible for the ground
landlord to see that the conditions are kept?”</p>

<p>Was told in <span class="no-break">reply:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>“The only way in which it is possible for him to do that
is to keep a very active supervision over his property.</p>

<p>“If that was done by ground landlords, and had always
been done by them, you would have personal supervision
carried out by a sufficient number of people to ensure the
conditions being kept.”</p>

<p>Any idea of property having its duties as well as its rights
appears to have been non-existent.</p>

<p>Next to the land-owner was the numerous and varied
class of house “owners,” from the man who leased the
land from the landlord and built the house, or who had
leased the house and had sub-leased it to some one else.
And often there were sub-lessees, until in some cases there
was a chain of persons holding different interests in the
same house.</p>

<p>And there was the class of persons who take a house
and break it up into tenement-rooms, and who were known
as “house-knackers,” or house jobbers, or house farmers,
or as “middlemen,” these last being defined as any one
who stands between the freeholder and the one who
occupies.</p>

<p>Some interesting descriptions of some of these “middlemen”
were given.</p>

<p>One of the largest in Clerkenwell was a Mr. Decimus
Ball, and there was also a Mr. Ross—both of whom were
on the Vestry.</p>

<p>The witness stated that these men had neglected the
houses, and in many cases were very extortionate in their
demands against the occupants.</p>

<p>Mr. Ball had many houses which were inhabited by
families in single rooms, but which up to a short time
previously were inhabited by whole families to a house.</p>

<p>Mr. Ball’s profit is “perfectly enormous if he does not
do any repairs.” And he made very few; and if the rent
were not paid on the Monday morning, he threatened to
raise it.</p>

<p>Probably the most notorious “middleman” was a certain
Mr. Flight.</p>

<p>“He must have been the owner of thousands and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
thousands of houses in the metropolis.” (18,000, it was
said.)</p>

<p>“He owned property in every part of London, and the
squalid nature of that property, the wretched condition in
which it has been kept, the avoidance of all decent rules by
which habitations are governed, was something very fearful.”</p>

<p>“Middlemen,” it was stated, sometimes appeared to be
making 150 per cent. per annum, but they assert that repairs
have to come out of that. Repairs, however, were only
executed once in three or four years, and in the others they
get their 150 per cent.</p>

<p>“If the house-farmers do no repairs for years the profits
are large…. They collect their rents very sharply.</p>

<p>“The middleman makes the tenant pay an excessive rent
because he insists upon making an excessive profit.”</p>

<p>The great work which the Commission did was in the
enlightenment of the public, and the material they afforded
for the formation of public opinion in the right direction.
Subsequent experience showed that the recommendations
made—excellent and helpful as so many of them were—did
not by a long way cut deep enough to extirpate
the more serious evils.</p>

<p>“It is evident,” wrote the Commissioners, “that the
35th Section of the Sanitary Act of 1866 (dealing with
tenement-houses) which contains a remedy for some of
the evils which have been described is likely to remain
a dead letter in many districts of the metropolis until some
improved means be devised for putting it into action.”
They recommended that the local authorities who had
not already made and enforced bye-laws under the section
“should proceed to do so.”</p>

<p>But no compulsion was suggested to make them do so,
or for the only effective alternative, the provision of other
machinery to act in their default, and so the local authorities
were in this matter allowed to remain in their position
of complete independence and to continue their policy of
inactivity—if not obstruction.</p>

<p>As to inspection, and the inadequacy of a sanitary staff,
much evidence had been given, but, they <span class="no-break">remarked:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is evident that where work is performed according
to the custom of certain districts of the metropolis it really
does not matter whether the staff of inspectors be large or
small.”</p>

<p>They summed up their general view in the following
<span class="no-break">passage:—</span></p>

<p>“Without entering upon questions of policy of far wider
application than the more immediate subject-matter of
the present inquiry, Your Majesty’s Commissioners are
clearly of opinion that there has been failure in administration
rather than in legislation, although the latter is no
doubt capable of improvement. What at the present time
is specially required is some motive power, and probably
there can be no stronger motive power than public opinion.”</p>

<p>And with that view they recommended that inquiries
should be held as to the immediate sanitary requirements
of different districts, and the reports be presented to
Parliament.</p>

<p>Public opinion, however, is hard to move, and usually
slow in moving; and when it has at last decided on definite
action Parliament is slow in giving effect to the decision,
and, when Parliament at last acts, the legislation itself
is frequently defective. And so the outlook was rather
hopeless.</p>

<p>Various other more concrete amendments were, however,
suggested in the various Housing Acts to render them more
effective for their purpose.</p>

<p>And, as a result, in the session of Parliament of 1885
a Bill was introduced dealing with the “Housing of the
Working Classes.”</p>

<p>Lord Salisbury, in moving the second reading, said<a id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a><span class="no-break">:—</span></p>

<p>The Bill he introduced was to a certain extent “a
compromise.” “No one need expect to find that it contains
any magic formula which will cure all the evils of
which this House and the public have heard a great
deal, and there is nothing startling, sensational or extreme
in its provisions. We are hoping to cure these evils by
slow and gradual steps, by the application of remedies
apparently not far-reaching in their character, but still
judiciously directed to the precise difficulties which arose
in each department of our inquiry.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>
<p>The Bill duly passed (48 &amp; 49 Vic. cap. 72).</p>

<p>Most of the reforms embodied in it were of a trifling
character and such as could have only the most limited
and gradual effect.</p>

<p>This Act extended generally the operation of the Labouring
Classes Lodging Houses Acts of 1851 and 1867, and
substituted the Metropolitan Board of Works for the
Vestries and District Boards as the authority under the Act.</p>

<p>A really useful plan was authorised by it, namely, the
sale, at a fair market price, to the Metropolitan Board
of certain prison sites in London for housing purposes.
And one other good thing done was depriving the owner
of insanitary premises, which had been pulled down by
order of the local authority, of the power to require the
local authority to purchase such premises.</p>

<p>But merely again to <span class="no-break">declare—</span></p>

<p>“That it shall be the duty of every local authority entrusted
with the laws relating to public health and local
government to put in force the powers with which they
are invested so as to secure the proper sanitary condition
of all premises within the area under their control”—was
futile, considering that the authorities in question
had steadily ignored the same direction, made nineteen
years previously, in the Act of 1866.</p>

<p>Lord Salisbury wound up his speech with the following
abnegation of Parliamentary <span class="no-break">power:—</span></p>

<p>“We must not imagine that it is anything we can do
in this House, or in the House of Commons, that will
remove all these evils. It must be done by that stirring
up of public opinion which these investigations cause;
it is to this that we must look for any real reform, it must
be from the people themselves, from the owners, builders,
and occupiers, when their attention is drawn to the
enormous evils which past negligence has caused, it is
from them that the cure of the sanitary evils which have
so largely increased the death-rate must come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Considering, however, the accumulated mass of evidence
which had shown beyond all question that it was the
owners and builders who were mainly responsible for those
“enormous evils,” and who were still hard at work adding
to them and perpetuating them, it was rather hopeless
to expect “the cure of the sanitary evils” to come from
that quarter.</p>

<p>Unfortunately two general elections, and the heated
discussion of great political questions, threw even these
great health questions into the background, and not so
much immediate benefit as was to be hoped followed the
inquiry of the Royal Commissioners.</p>

<p>It is an awful handicap to the welfare of a community,
and of a nation, when those who should take a principal
share in the duty of raising the physical, social, and
moral condition of the people over whom they can exercise
influence, and who are more or less under their control,
not alone stand idly aside, but absolutely exploit the
misery and helplessness and ignorance of masses of the
people.</p>

<p>The Imperial Government may make most excellent
laws, but the physical and sanitary welfare of the people
cannot be secured by a local governing authority alone,
nor their moral and religious welfare by the Churches alone.</p>

<p>There is a great sphere of life where those who stand
in the relation of land-owners or house-owners to tenants
could exercise an enormous influence for good, and where
nobody else could exercise it so effectually or so easily.</p>

<p>But the disaster has been that in the great metropolis—the
greatest of all cities—a vast proportion of those who
ought to have been active in using this influence, have
never made the slightest effort to use it, whilst others
have used their position, and the dependence of the people
upon them, solely to wring from them the last farthing
that could be extracted.</p>

<p>And these were the men who made the loudest protests
and outcry against legislation and against administration
which was to make them do that which the vital interests
of the community and of the State required to be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>The root of the evil connected with the housing of
the people in London lay with the disregard of “owners”
for the condition of their tenants.</p>

<p>Many “owners” appeared to be under the impression
that their investment in house property was to be as free
from trouble or labour as money invested in the national
funds is; and so long as they got the rent they expected,
they did not trouble themselves about the state of the
houses or of the people living therein. They were loth
to spend money on them, as that curtailed their income,
and the argument was constantly used that it was useless
spending money to put the property in order, when
anything they did to it would be promptly destroyed.
And they cared not who were their tenants so long as a
high rent was obtainable from them.</p>

<p>Some declared that the people were so sunken, so
degraded, so filthy, and depraved, and destructive, that
nothing they could do could secure their property being
kept in a sanitary or decent condition.</p>

<p>Doubtless in many districts and many cases the conduct
of the tenants was as bad as bad could be. As one of the
Medical Officers of Health wrote in <span class="no-break">1883:—</span></p>

<p>“It must be borne in mind that many of the occupants
of tenement property are careless and filthy in their habits;
and in addition are very destructive; fittings put up one
day are pulled down and destroyed the next; ash-bin covers,
closet doors, and even flooring boards, share the same fate.”</p>

<p>And many were the “owners” of various degree who
endeavoured to justify their neglect on this ground.</p>

<p>Were such an argument admitted, the owner could claim
to be exonerated from the duty of keeping his property
in proper order, and the evil conditions and consequences
resulting from his neglect would go on increasing indefinitely,
until a state of things destructive to the community
was ultimately reached.</p>

<p>Viewed broadly, and impartially, there was much truth
as regarded the misconduct and uncleanliness of great
numbers of tenants, but the central fact was that the
“owner” was the person mainly interested in, and benefited
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
by possession of the property, and therefore primarily
responsible for maintaining it in a condition which should
not endanger the health of the community.</p>

<p>If, through the neglect and indifference of his predecessors,
the property had fallen into a bad state, the consequences
equitably fell upon him, just as the consequences of any
other bad investment by his predecessor would have done.
He had inherited something which was not worth as much
as he anticipated—that was all; but the consequences must
not be shifted on to the community, nor must his tenants
be made the victims.</p>

<p>And if he allowed his property to become a danger to
his tenants, and through them to the community at large,
the community had an absolute right to protect itself by
insisting that he should be prevented from so doing.</p>

<p>The only way in which, in the interests of the public,
abuses can be prevented is by holding the person responsible
for them who has the power of preventing them. And
that was just what in this case the “owners” did not
like.</p>

<p>Building constituted an important part of the housing
problem. The Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth,
in his report for 1887, gave an interesting account of the
process of building in London which shows how even the
amended Building Acts had failed to secure those conditions
of air and space which are essential for health.</p>

<p>“In proximity to the centres of business every available
plot of garden or recreation ground has been converted
into building sites. Houses constructed from materials
of the poorest quality and by workmen employed only for
the cheapness of their labour, have been hurried into
occupation.</p>

<p>“The system of close building, at first confined in its
application to the consolidation of the inner zone, has
been adopted in the outer, and with the demand for
shelter, which increases in a progressive ratio with the
growth of the population, the once open suburbs must
ere long become indistinguishable in the monotony of house
row and pavement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>“The art of close building appears a progressive one.
In its infancy, twenty years ago, the art has now arrived at
a stage nearly approaching perfection. In the earlier
examples the space allotted to garden land was larger
than that built on. Then the size of the two quantities
reached an equality—then the covered ground becomes
a larger quantity than the uncovered land, until the final
stage of development is attained when the extreme limit
of encroachment permitted by the Building Act is reached,
and garden land is represented by a yard 100 superficial feet
in area.”</p>

<p>Extraordinary loopholes in the sanitary laws, moreover,
were constantly being discovered which almost neutralised
the original enactment.</p>

<p>Thus the Medical Officer of Health for Camberwell
remarked in his report for <span class="no-break">1888:—</span></p>

<p>“It has been long known to the Sanitary Committee
that there has never been any efficient supervision of the
drainage and other sanitary arrangements of houses in
course of construction…. It is true that every builder
has been required before constructing his private drains
and connecting them with the public sewers, to send in
a plan of his proposed drainage for the sanction of the
Surveyor. But there has been no machinery by which
builders could be compelled to carry out their private
works in accordance with the plans submitted, and to
ensure that the details of their works had been carried
out in a workmanlike or efficient manner. The inspections
of houses even recently built have shown that sanitary
nuisances complained of have been largely due to scandalous
neglect of duty on the part of those concerned in
carrying out the drainage works, and that in most cases
the plans sent in have not accorded with the arrangements
finally adopted.”</p>

<p>Various, indeed, were matters connected with the public
health which unexpectedly came cropping up; sometimes
matters thought to have been disposed of but only partly
so, sometimes, wholly new origins and ramifications of
insanitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus in 1886 the Medical Officer of Health for the south
part of Poplar District drew special attention to a grievance
long previously complained of and for many years endured.</p>

<p>“A greater scandal cannot well be shown in matters
vital to health than that in spite of abundant evidence
of the magnitude of the evil, thousands and tens of
thousands of families living in houses, the rates of which
are payable by the landlords, may at any moment, without
a particle of fault of their own, be suddenly denied one
of the first necessaries of life—water—through the neglect
and wilfulness of others.”</p>

<p>The main remedy open to the water companies to
recover rates from defaulting non-resident owners of
tenement-houses was the simple expedient of discontinuing
the supply of water. This course was open to a double
objection—first, tenants who had paid their rent were
deprived of that for which they had constructively paid;
and secondly, a tenement-house deprived of water might
speedily become a focus of disease.</p>

<p>“That disease and death are directly traceable to this
want,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health, “no one acquainted
with sanitary work in London can doubt. Take
this instance. Water cut off, drains stopped, opening
up of ground and drains, removal of filth accumulations,
horrid stench, diphtheria, death.</p>

<p>“In Hanbury Place—having six houses—there was no
water supply for twenty-six days, and families numbering
each seven, nine, two of six, and others had to exist in
May, 1885, with choked drains, yard flooded with sewage,
and no water—and all because of non-payment of rates by
the landlord.”</p>

<p>In 1887 Parliament happily dealt with this evil, and by
an Act passed in that <span class="no-break">year—</span></p>

<p>“Water companies were prohibited from cutting off the
water supply from any dwelling-house for non-payment of
water rate, if such rate were payable by the owner and not
the occupier of the premises….”</p>

<p>In the middle of this decade, too, anxiety revived, owing
to the state of the Thames, a matter which it was hoped
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
had been finally disposed of. The discharge of sewage at
the new outfalls make the river in those parts much what it
had previously been in London.</p>

<p>A Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the
subject. They reported that they found a condition of
things which they “must denounce as a disgrace to the
metropolis and to civilisation.” They said that in 1884
“the sewage water from the outfalls manifestly reached
London Bridge.”</p>

<p>“At Greenwich Pier the water was very black, and the
smell exceedingly strong.”</p>

<p>“At Woolwich the river for its whole width was black,
putrid, sewage—looking as if unmixed and unalloyed. The
stench was intolerable.”</p>

<p>“We are of opinion that it is neither necessary nor
justifiable to discharge the sewage of the metropolis in its
crude state into any part of the Thames.”</p>

<p>This evil was surmounted by the adoption by the
Metropolitan Board of Works of a system of treatment of
the crude sewage. Chemical precipitation was effected by
adding to the sewage certain proportions of lime and
protosulphate of iron, and allowing it to remain for an
hour or two in settling tanks. The effluent water was
let flow into the river, and the sludge was carried down the
river in barges and cast into the sea.</p>

<p>The public interest evoked by the inquiries made by the
Royal Commissioners on Housing, and the publication of
their Report, certainly quickened the activity of many of
the local authorities.</p>

<p>In several of the parishes and districts the Regulations
under the Sanitary Acts of 1866 and 1874 were being more
readily adopted, and being put into force on a slightly
more extended scale; and in every case it was reported that
the results had been satisfactory, a great improvement
taking place in the houses which were registered.</p>

<p>A report of the Inspector of such houses, for Bermondsey,
describes this <span class="no-break">well:—</span></p>

<p>“108 were placed on Register by Vestry. The majority
of these houses are situated in the lowest and most densely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
populated parts of the parish. They are occupied by the
very poor, costermongers, dock and waterside labourers, &amp;c.
They contain 509 rooms, occupied by 386 families, numbering
1,434 persons. 285 rooms were overcrowded. With
three exceptions the overcrowding has been abated.
Previous to registration the number in each house was 13,
present average 9.”</p>

<p>“The sanitary condition of the said houses has been
greatly improved. Staircases, &amp;c., are now regularly swept
and washed. In 85 houses the walls have been stripped
and whitewashed. Many of the walls had 15 layers of
paper, thus hiding filth and harbouring vermin. Ventilation
in them is also improved. Many owners rendered
much assistance.”</p>

<p>Several inquiries of the sort suggested by the Royal
Commissioners were held in the course of the ensuing years
and reports presented to Parliament, but it is much to be
doubted whether they had any effect in so inciting public
opinion as to make it insist on the recalcitrant local
authorities carrying the laws into effect.</p>

<p>Clerkenwell, Mile-End-Old-Town, Bethnal Green, and
Rotherhithe, were inquired into, and reported on. The tale
was much the same as that set forth time after time, and
year after year, by various Medical Officers of Health—want
of adequate sanitary supervision, numerous neglects by the
Vestries, especially the neglect to make, or, if made, to
enforce Regulations under the Sanitary Acts of 1866
and 1874.</p>

<p>The initiative of dealing with the existing condition of
things rested with the Vestries. It was forcibly pointed
out that complaints could hardly be expected either from
the owners of insanitary houses, on whom the cost of the
improvements would fall, or from tenants who are too often
indifferent to considerations of health and cleanliness, and
who in any case would fear to offend their landlords by
complaining.</p>

<p>Rotherhithe came in for the strongest condemnation. Of
it the Commissioners <span class="no-break">reported:—</span></p>

<p>“It is, in fact, no exaggeration to say that the results of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
lax administration abound in Rotherhithe, and especially in
houses occupied by poor persons.”</p>

<p>The increase of the sanitary staff was recommended, but
the obdurate Vestry resolved not to increase it.</p>

<p>The absolute necessity of inspection was demonstrated
every day of the year to every Vestry and District Board
in the metropolis by the results of such exceedingly limited
inspection as was carried out.</p>

<p>In St. Luke, in 1890, of 1,348 houses inspected 296 were
found “in fair sanitary condition.”</p>

<p>In Hackney, in 1887, 5,213 were inspected; 3,620 of
them were found to be wanting in some sanitary requirement,
or were so dirty as to necessitate orders being served
for whitewashing and cleaning. In one street 111 houses
were inspected, and in 97 nuisances were found.</p>

<p>In St. Marylebone, in 1884, 2,136 orders were sent out
for repairs and various sanitary improvements. In Hammersmith,
3,377 notices to abate nuisances were served in
1886. In Westminster, 1,609 notices served for sanitary
defects.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Saviour, Southwark,
reported <span class="no-break">(1890–1):—</span></p>

<p>“The importance of house-to-house inspection may be
estimated by the fact that of 491 houses inspected, it was
found necessary in nearly every instance to serve notice for
the carrying out of urgent sanitary requirements.”</p>

<p>In Camberwell there were, in 1889, between 30,000 and
40,000 houses in the parish, “of which probably one-half
should be inspected periodically.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health of Bethnal Green <span class="no-break">stated:—</span></p>

<p>“In my district we have a population of about 130,000,
and about 18,000 houses, and we have two Inspectors.
Of course there should be periodical inspection, that is to
say, every house in the parish should be visited at least once
a year by a Sanitary Inspector, but that with the present
staff would be utterly impossible. In my district there is no
house-to-house visitation; we simply attend to complaints
as we receive them, and this completely fills up the time of
the two Inspectors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>And he further stated<a id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a><span class="no-break">:—</span></p>

<p>“In my district the Sanitary Inspectors are not under
the control of the Medical Officer of Health.”</p>

<p>It is of course manifest that if houses had not been
inspected, and the necessary sanitary improvements enforced,
things would have gone on rapidly deteriorating, and
with that deterioration would have come all those causes
of disease which would endanger the lives of the occupants
and create fresh centres for spreading disease broadcast.</p>

<p>It might have been thought that the numerous inquiries
into the condition of the working classes in factories and
workshops would have laid bare nearly all there was to
lay bare.</p>

<p>A report to the Board of Trade on the Sweating System
in the East End of London, by J. Burnett in 1887, rudely
dispelled such an idea, and opened out to public view a new
vista of causes, deleteriously affecting the public health, a
new area of insanitation. Though the evils depicted had
become acuter, they evidently had been going on for
years.</p>

<p>“The system may be defined as one under which sub-contractors
undertake to do work in their own houses or
small workshops, and employ others to do it, making a
profit for themselves by the difference between the contract
prices and the wages they pay their assistants.</p>

<p>“The mass of those employed under the sweating system
labour in workshops where much fewer than 20 are engaged,
or in the houses which may be single rooms of the ‘small
sweaters.’”</p>

<p>After referring to the numerous branches of the tailoring
trade, he <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“Immense numbers of people of both sexes and all ages
have rushed into the cheap tailoring trade as the readiest
means of finding employment. The result has been an
enormously overcrowded labour market, and a consequently
fierce competition among the workers themselves, with all
the attendant evils of such a state of things…. Matters
have been rendered infinitely worse by an enormous influx
of pauper foreigners from other European nations. The
result has been to flood the labour market of the East End
of London with cheap labour to such an extent as to
reduce thousands of native workers to the verge of destitution….”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>
<p>“There are, of course, in addition many English workers
employed in the same trade and in the same shops, but
their number is gradually being reduced, owing to the
severity of a competition in which those who can subsist on
least are sure to be victorious.</p>

<p>“The object of the sweater being his own gain, the
inevitable tendency of such a system is to grind the
workers down to the lowest possible level….</p>

<p>“The character of the workshops, or places used as
workshops, varies considerably. The smaller sweaters use
part of their dwelling accommodation, and in the vast
majority of cases work is carried on under conditions in the
highest degree filthy and unsanitary.”</p>

<p>“In small rooms, not more than nine or ten feet square,
heated by a coke fire for the pressers’ irons, and at night
lighted by flaring gas jets, six, eight, ten, or even a dozen
workers may be crowded.</p>

<p>“The conditions of the Public Health Acts, and of the
Factory and Workshop Regulation Acts, are utterly disregarded,
and existing systems of inspection are entirely
inadequate to enforce their provisions even if no divided
authority tended to weaken the hands of the Inspectors.</p>

<p>“Some of the shops are hidden in garrets and back rooms
of the worst kinds of East End tenements, and a third of
them cannot be known to the Factory Inspectors.</p>

<p>“It is in regulating the hours of the women that factory
inspection should be of most service, but how can two or
three Inspectors keep in check the multitude of sweating
dens of East London? Basements, garrets, backyards,
wash-houses, and all sorts of unlooked for and unsuspected
places are the abodes of the sweater.”</p>

<p>Early in the following year Lord Dunraven, in the House
of Lords, moved for the appointment of a Select Committee
to inquire into the sweating system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>“The evils which existed there were caused by natural
laws which were not by any means of necessity unwholesome
in any degree…. But his belief was that though the
causes were perfectly natural in themselves they had been
allowed to run riot, and had not been put under proper
control, and had thus produced the present terrible state
of things….</p>

<p>“Large workshops were the exception. In the ‘dens’ of
the sweaters there was not the slightest attempt at decency;
men and women worked together for many consecutive
hours, penned up in small rooms and basements, garrets,
backyards, wash-houses, and all sorts of unlikely places,
were the abodes of the sweaters.”</p>

<p>And he quoted the Chief Inspector of Factories and
<span class="no-break">Workshops:—</span></p>

<p>“To add to the evils of overwork pursued by these people,
we must note the overcrowded, ill-ventilated, and excessively
hot state of the workrooms; … it is surprising how such
people can live under such conditions.</p>

<p>“… It was,” he said, “a ridiculous and scandalous
thing that Parliament should pass Factory and Sanitary
Acts regulating the hours of labour of women and children,
and that those Acts should be grossly violated.”</p>

<p>Lord Sandhurst <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“It might appear to their Lordships almost incredible
that within three or four miles of that House a state of
things, involving so much human misery, could possibly
exist as was to be found at the East End of London.”</p>

<p>The Select Committee was appointed. The results of its
inquiries are stated in the next chapter.</p>

<p>In 1888 the local government of London underwent a most
notable change.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1887 various rumours gained
currency as to questionable dealings in connection with
the lettings of land owned by the Metropolitan Board.
Certain officials of the Board were mentioned. The details
do not fall within the history of the sanitary evolution of
London, except so far as they affected the central governing
authority of London. The allegations made received increasing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
confirmation, and early in 1888 a Royal Commission
was appointed to inquire into and thoroughly sift them, and
early in May the Commission held its first sitting, the
Metropolitan Board affording every facility for the thorough
investigation of the matter.</p>

<p>Before that time, however—namely, in March—the
Government had introduced into the House of Commons its
proposals as regarded the local government of England and
Wales generally; and the opportunity was taken to deal
with the great problem of London government which had
so long vexed and perplexed successive governments, and
which was becoming more and more insistent as years went
on, and London was accordingly included in the general
scheme.</p>

<p>By the measure now introduced London was to be
created—not a Corporation, nor a Municipality, but a
County—with a Council as the governing authority of the
County.</p>

<p>Mr. Ritchie, introducing the Bill into the House of
Commons, said<a id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a><span class="no-break">:—</span></p>

<p>“We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that whereas every
other borough in the country possesses a body directly
representing the ratepayers, no such body exists in London.</p>

<p>“There is no one elected by, or responsible to the ratepayers.</p>

<p>“We propose to take London, as defined under the Metropolis
Management Act, out of the counties of Middlesex,
Surrey, and Kent, and we propose to create it a County of
London by itself, with a Lord Lieutenant, a Bench of
Magistrates, and a County Council of its own.</p>

<p>“We propose that the Council shall be directly elected by
the ratepayers, as in all other counties and boroughs—that
the franchise shall be the same—and that it shall consist,
as in all other cases, of elected and selected members; the
elected members sitting for three years, the selected for
six years (one-half of their number retiring every three
years).</p>

<p>“It will take over the licensing powers and all the duties
of the Metropolitan Board of Works, which will cease to
exist.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>
<p>The “City” of London was to be allowed to retain its
separate existence within the new County, together with
its ancient privileges and immunities for the most part
unaltered and untouched.</p>

<p>The Bill developed into an Act, which created a new
central authority for London, under the title of the London
County Council.</p>

<p>The area of the new “Administrative County” of London
was made co-extensive with that of the former district of
the Metropolitan Board of Works.</p>

<p>And to the new Authority was transferred the powers,
duties, and liabilities of the Metropolitan Board of Works;
and to those were added functions much wider and more
extensive than those of that Board.</p>

<p>The Act also conferred upon the Council the power of
appointing a Medical Officer of Health for the County, and
additional powers of making bye-laws.</p>

<p>It did not, however, materially interfere with the
Vestries and District Boards, nor did it alter their relation
to the Central Authority. Practically it left them
untouched.</p>

<p>The Council was to consist of 137 members, of whom
118 were to be elected triennially by direct election in the
various metropolitan constituencies, and 19 to be elected by
the Council itself as Aldermen.</p>

<p>Finally, the Act set a limit to the existence of the Metropolitan
Board of Works.</p>

<p>While the Bill was going through Parliament the Royal
Commission had been pursuing its inquiry into the allegations
made against that Board, and had ascertained that
several of the officials had been carrying <span class="no-break">on—</span></p>

<p>“… A nefarious course of proceeding by which they
had been able to obtain for themselves large sums of money
out of dealings with the Board’s land.”</p>

<p>And <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“… Two of the members of the Board in the architectural
profession had availed themselves of their representative
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
position to make personal profit out of some of the
business which came before them.”</p>

<p>Under the growing disfavour with which public authorities
were regarded who were only indirectly elected, and so not
amenable to the influence or control of the electorate, it is
improbable that the existence of the Metropolitan Board of
Works would have been much prolonged. But it was an
unfortunate ending to a great public body which had done
really great service to London.</p>

<p>Its own final words<a id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> may be quoted in its <span class="no-break">defence:—</span></p>

<p>“It has been a source of pain and sorrow to the Board
that, at the close of thirty-three years’ administration of the
local affairs of London, which has been attended with at least
some measure of success, and in the course of which the
Board has carried out some of the greatest works of public
utility of which any city can boast, its good name has during
the last year of its existence been sullied by iniquitous proceedings
of which, though carried on in its midst, its
members as a body were entirely without knowledge. It is
some satisfaction to remember, however, that a body of
Commissioners, who in a judicial spirit made the most
searching inquiry into the Board’s proceedings, were able,
while exposing the wrong-doings which were revealed to
them, and justly distributing the blame, to speak of the
Board, as they do in their report, in the following <span class="no-break">terms:—</span></p>

<p>“‘It has had a multitude of duties to perform, and very
great works have been constructed by it, which have transformed
the face of some of the most important thoroughfares
of the metropolis. And there has hitherto been no evidence
that corruption or malpractice has affected or marred the
greater part of the work which it has accomplished. The
same may be said, too, in relation to the conduct of the vast
majority of the members of the Board. We have received
very numerous communications, some anonymous, some
bearing the signature of the writers, impugning the action
of the Board and certain of its members, but against the
vast majority of them not even a suspicion of corruption or
misconduct has been breathed. We believe that many
members of the Board have cheerfully given for the public
good much valuable time, and have rendered most important
public services.’”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>
<p>The change in the constitution, nature, and character of
the central authority of London effected by the Act was
momentous and far-reaching.</p>

<p>Instead of an indirectly elected body such as the Metropolitan
Board of Works, over which the inhabitants of
London had practically no control, there was brought into
being a body directly chosen by an electorate of nearly half
a million of the ratepayers of the metropolis, responsive to
the views and desires of the electorate, endowed with the
great authority derived from its representative character,
and entrusted with the carrying out of the views and policy
of London as one great city.</p>

<p>London had been unified and welded together into one
whole by the constitution of its new central authority; for
the first time in his history it had been given a voice—the
voice of one great city—and though much remained to be
done before its entrance into its full rights as one city—and
that the greatest which has ever existed in the world—the
idea had been born, and had been embodied in the statutes
of the realm that London was one great city, and not a mere
conglomeration of petty jarring authorities.</p>

<p>The first election of councillors took place on January 17,
1889.</p>

<p>The first meeting of the Council took place on the 21st of
March, when the Earl of Rosebery was elected Chairman,
and the Council entered energetically on the work lying
before it.</p>

<p>The sanitary evolution of London was vitally involved in
the change, but it was at once discovered that the powers
of the Council relating to the public health of London were
of a very limited and unsatisfactory nature.</p>

<p>Matters concerning it were regulated by the Metropolis
London Management Act and a large number of other Acts,
the execution of which was in the hands of the Vestries and
District Boards.</p>

<p>These bodies were practically uncontrolled, and no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
machinery existed for securing any uniformity of administration
in the different parts of the county.</p>

<p>And even the Metropolitan Board had not used certain
powers it possessed of making bye-laws for certain sanitary
purposes.</p>

<p>“We cannot,” reported the Sanitary Committee of the
Council, “too strongly emphasise our opinion that the
London County Council should be empowered to frame bye-laws
for the proper sanitary government of London, that
the new or existing local bodies should put them in force,
and that the County Council should be the supervising body
to see that they are properly carried out.”</p>

<p>A somewhat similar report was made by the Housing of
the Working Classes Committee.</p>

<p>“The Committee,” they said, “feels that until the law is
strengthened, and fuller powers to enforce the law are placed
in the hands of the Council, its action in dealing with
insanitary areas will be of an imperfect character.”</p>

<p>The question of the housing of the poor in London was at
once energetically taken up by the new body.</p>

<p>Representations were made to the Government as to the
necessity of the Acts relating to the housing of the working
classes being consolidated and amended.</p>

<p>Consequent upon this, the Government introduced a Bill
which was passed—“The Housing of the Working
Classes Act, 1890,”<a id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> which repealed and codified fourteen
enactments, all having for their object the improvement of
the dwellings of the artizan and labouring classes, and the
clearing away of unhealthy areas. Very large powers were
placed in the hands of the Council and of the district authorities
to secure the better housing of the working classes.
And the Act may be said to mark a new era in the history of
reform in the matter of insanitary areas, giving full power to
the Council as a central authority to enforce its provisions.</p>

<p>Before the end of this decade Parliament passed two other
Acts of great advantage to the health of London. One was,
“The Infectious Diseases Notification Act, 1889,” making
the notification of certain specified diseases compulsory in
London—smallpox, cholera, diphtheria, membraneous croup,
erysipelas, scarlet fever, typhus, and other fevers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>In accordance with well-worn usage London had been left
behind in this matter. Other cities and even towns had, by
means of local Acts, secured the advantages of such legislation
long before. So far back as 1874, indeed, machinery
had been in existence in London for the notification of
infectious disease in houses let in lodgings. But owing to
the neglect of the majority of the Vestries and District Boards
to make or enforce regulations under the Sanitary Act of
1866, that machinery was left unused to the great detriment
of the people of London. Thousands of lives must have
been sacrificed by this neglect, and innumerable cases of
preventable disease not prevented. It was not until a
general Act was passed that London became possessed of
the advantages resulting from such notification.</p>

<p>In London, indeed, the health of cattle was better looked
after in this respect than that of the people, for cases of
infectious disease in cattle had to be notified to the Sanitary
Authorities.</p>

<p>By this Act it was made compulsory on medical attendants
to certify, and on householders to notify, the existence of
any of these diseases.</p>

<p>Hitherto information as to infectious illness only reached
the Medical Officer of Health after a sufficient time had
elapsed to allow of the spread of the infection.</p>

<p>The results of the Act of 1889 were soon found to be very
beneficial in checking the spread of disease.</p>

<p>The receipt of the notices of infectious diseases led to the
more prompt and general disinfection of premises where
infectious diseases prevailed, and led also to the discovery
of sanitary defects which might not otherwise have been
discovered.</p>

<p>The information, moreover, kept the Medical Officers of
Health informed of the progress of disease not only in their
own districts, but also in contiguous ones, and so assisted
them to take prompt measures for the eradication of disease
in their respective districts.</p>

<p>The other measure which passed the legislature in this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
same year contained provisions of the highest importance
as affecting the metropolis. This was “the Poor Law Act,
1889.”</p>

<p>Until 1889 patients could be admitted only to the infectious
hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board on the
order of the Relieving Officer and District Medical Officer,
so, except in certain cases, the hospitals were only open to
Poor Law cases.</p>

<p>This measure made practical concession of two principles.
Free admission to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums
Board of sick persons in need of isolation, and devolution
upon the Metropolitan Poor Fund of all charges incurred in
the maintenance of the sick in those hospitals.</p>

<p>The Managers were, therefore, enabled to admit other
than pauper patients reasonably believed to be suffering from
fever, smallpox, or diphtheria.</p>

<p>The system was attended with the happiest results in
reducing the amount of infectious disease in the metropolis,
and proved a great boon to all classes of the community.</p>

<p>The Board in its annual report <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The Managers are now, for the first time since the
establishment of the Board in 1867, virtually recognised as
the Metropolitan Authority for the provision of accommodation
for the isolation and treatment of infectious disease—both
pauper and non-pauper—and are now empowered to
legally perform duties which the Legislature had imposed
on the District Sanitary Authorities, but which the
Managers had hitherto been called upon to perform in consequence
of the failure of most of such Authorities to provide
accommodation for non-pauper patients.”</p>

<p>The Managers by this date had increased the accommodation
for patients afflicted with any of these infectious
diseases. There were six fever hospitals, 2,463 beds; 350
beds in smallpox hospital ships; and 800 beds in the hospital
for convalescing smallpox patients.</p>

<p>One other Act<a id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> deserves mention before the close of this
decade as it contained an unique section which required the
Medical Officer of Health, on notice from the owner of
property in which there are separate dwellings let for 7s. 6d.
or less a week, to visit them and examine all their sanitary
arrangements, &amp;c., so as to be able to certify or <span class="no-break">not—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>“That the house is so constructed as to afford suitable
accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting
it, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements.”</p>

<p>The certificate, if granted, was to be handed to the owner,
who was then able to obtain the remission of the inhabited
house duty.</p>

<p>The owner, therefore, obtained a remission of taxes to
which he was justly liable, because the dwelling which he
lets was in a sanitary condition!</p>

<p>In many ways, then, the sanitary evolution of the great
city was developing satisfactorily, though by no means so
rapidly as was to be desired, or as it might have developed if
local governing authorities had done their duty.</p>

<p>“The war of the community against individuals for the
public good,” which had now lasted for over thirty years,
and the war against disease in its most dangerous forms, was
being waged with good effect; and though an immensity
remained to be done, a great deal had been accomplished.
Larger numbers of all classes were beginning to grasp the
idea and to realise that the necessity of securing and
guarding the public health was not a craze or form of
mental aberration, but was of absolutely vital consequence,
not merely to certain classes but to the great community of
the metropolis and to the nation itself, and that the future
welfare and power, even the very existence, of the nation
are dependent upon it.</p>

<p>Larger numbers, too, were beginning to see who really
were responsible for the widely prevalent evils, and who really
were obstructing progress towards a higher standard of
public health, and how little claim they had to consideration,
either from the hands of the Legislature or of local
administrators.</p>

<p>The reports of the Medical Officers of Health of the
latter part of this decade were distinctly more hopeful in
tone, and recorded more progress than ever before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>The catalogue of things in which improvement had taken
place had lengthened—sewerage, water supply, the removal
of refuse, paving, the regulation of offensive businesses, of
cowhouses, dairies, and bakehouses, the provision of open
spaces, the better disinfection of houses and of infected
articles, the erection of hospitals for the isolation of cases
of infectious diseases—all of which things were elemental
necessaries if the public health was to be assured.</p>

<p>In some parishes, in place of the smaller class of houses,
great blocks of artizans’ dwellings had been erected. In
others great blocks of flats.</p>

<p>With the increased wealth of the population finer
buildings had been erected in many districts. London
had grown enormously in wealth, and the wealth showed
itself in finer public buildings and private houses. The
District Board of Westminster, for instance, said in their
report for <span class="no-break">1885–6:—</span></p>

<p>“Whether viewed as to its character, its statistics, its
topography, or its sanitary condition, the change which
Westminster has undergone in thirty years can only be
described as a complete transformation.”</p>

<p>“In the St. Margaret’s portion, whole streets of fine
houses which were occupied by the nobility and the
wealthy for residential purposes are now let out in offices
for the transaction of legal, scientific, or mechanical business,
while narrow streets, wretched courts, and melancholy
homes of squalid poverty and misery have been replaced
by ‘mansions,’ ‘flats,’ &amp;c.; and on the other hand by huge

homes.”</p>

<p>The Education Act was indirectly producing some good
results as regarded the health of the rising generation.</p>

of children at school ages. Mortality has <span class="no-break">lessened—</span><br /><br /></p>

<p class="p1 noind">due to the fact that children had been gathered into the
schools from their crowded and insanitary homes, and had
thus escaped some of the perils of disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth referred
to this same subject in his report for <span class="no-break">1886:—</span></p>

<p>“The children of the pauper and mendicant are withdrawn
from the atmosphere of vice and intemperance to
which their fathers had become acclimatised, and are placed
under supervision in the schoolroom….”</p>

<p>Some slight improvement there was also as regarded the
mortality of children under five years, though in many
parishes it was still fearfully high.</p>

<p>In Mile-End-Old-Town, for instance, in 1890 the
deaths under five years amounted to 51 per cent. of all
deaths. In Deptford district in 1890–1 they amounted to
50 per cent. In Bermondsey in 1889 they amounted
to 52 per cent. In St. Olave, Southwark, in 1888–9 to
49½ per cent. In St. Mary, Newington, in 1890, very
slightly under 50 per cent.</p>

<p>Infantile mortality was becoming of greater concern than
ever as the birth-rate was showing a decided diminution—that
for 1889 being the lowest on record since 1849.</p>

<p>Though the tables as to death-rate in many of the parishes
were still more or less vitiated by various local circumstances,
there was considerable unanimity that the death-rate was
falling and the public health better. Some diseases which
had previously claimed their victims by thousands, now only
claimed them by hundreds. Death from tubercular disease
had steadily fallen, and the mean death-rate from phthisis
in London showed a very satisfactory decrease between
1861–70 and 1881–90.<a id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>The <cite>Lancet</cite> of January, 1887, stated that, measured by
its recorded death-rate, London was healthier in 1887 than
in any year on record.</p>

<p>In the Strand in <span class="no-break">1886:—</span></p>

<p>“The efforts that have been made by the Board and its
officers have resulted in a marked and continuous improvement
in the sanitary state of the district.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>
<p>In St. Pancras in 1888 the death-rate was “by far the
lowest yet recorded.”</p>

<p>In Bermondsey, in the same year, “so few deaths have
not occurred since 1865.”</p>

<p>These and similar reports from other districts showed
that sanitary progress was being made. But, unfortunately,
in the autumn of 1888 there was an epidemic of measles of
exceptional severity, which raised the death-rate. And in
1890 there was a sudden increase from 18·4 per 1,000 to 21·4,
a mortality which was higher than any since 1882.</p>

<p>The increase served to show the great necessity there was
for unceasing watchfulness and for steady perseverance in
sanitary work. The forces of disease are ever on the watch
for the opportunity to work their evil will, and there were
still many weak places in the defences against them. The
central government of London had been improved enormously,
but the corrective was not extended to where it was
most wanted, namely, the local Sanitary Authorities, the
Vestries and District Boards.</p>

<h2 class="chaptHead"><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center">1891–1901</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">In</span> 1891 the census once more gave authoritative figures as
to the population of the metropolis of London. The
population had increased from 3,830,297 to 4,228,317.</p>

<p>The increase had been in a somewhat lower ratio than the
population of England and Wales as a whole, and the fact
was notable inasmuch as it was the first time that such a
phenomenon had presented itself, London having been
found in every preceding intercensal period to have gained
more or less in its proportions as compared with the country
at large.</p>

<p>The movements of population had followed very much the
same lines as in the previous decade. In the central parts—under
the pressure of the great economic forces—the population
had increased. In the outer parts it had increased, but
“the wide belt of suburbs was beginning to show some
signs of repletion.”</p>

<p>Immigration into London had greatly diminished in the
decade. Fewer immigrants had come from the various
counties of England and Wales, and the proportion of the
inhabitants of London who had been born elsewhere had
fallen from 308 persons per 1,000 in 1881 to 283 in 1891.</p>

<p>Thus the influx of country people, mostly in the prime of
life, and the admixture of fresh country blood into the urban
population of London was undergoing diminution—a circumstance
which, in the long run, would materially influence
the physique of the people.</p>

<p>Three important facts came into view with the figures set
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
out in the census, giving food for thoughtful minds as
regarded the future of London.</p>

<p>The first was that the rate of increase of the population
had again slackened off. The flood tide of population was
not now flowing so fast.</p>

<p>The second was that the population was being affected by
migration. The natural increase of the population had been
510,384, the actual increase 396,199—so that London had
lost by the excess of emigration over immigration more
than 114,000 persons. This was the first time such an event
had happened.</p>

<p>London’s boundaries, however, were very arbitrary and
haphazard, and this emigration was probably only to places
immediately outside London for residence at night, whilst
work was performed in London during the day—as illustrated
by the “City” and the Strand, where huge differences
existed between the day and night populations. The figures
showed, however, a movement of population which was
bound to have an effect upon the sanitary condition of the
people.</p>

<p>A third and portentous fact, ascertained correctly by aid
of the census figures, was the decline of the birth-rate in
London. This had fallen remarkably since 1881. It was
then 34·7 per 1,000 living. It was now 31·9.</p>

<p>Deducible from the census figures, reliable calculations
could also be made as to the death-rate in the metropolis.</p>

<p>In 1891 it was practically the same as in 1881, being 21·4
per 1,000. It might be inferred that these latter figures did
not afford much testimony to the effects of sanitary administration
and labours, but the pause in the steady decline was
only a temporary one.</p>

<p>The authoritative and accurate records thus afforded
decennially by the census are invaluable in tracing some of
the most important developments in the sanitary evolution
of London.</p>

<p>Another very noteworthy change was also brought into
prominence by the census. This was the continued rapid
growth of the population immediately outside the boundaries
of the County of London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Between 1871 and 1881 it had increased 312,000. Between
1881 and 1891 it had increased by 469,000, and now
in 1891 it stood at 1,405,000, having more than doubled
since 1871.</p>

<p>A passage in the report of the Medical Officer of Health
for Islington in 1895 illustrates this so far as his own
district was <span class="no-break">concerned:—</span></p>

<p>“The fact cannot be burked that many of the better
classes have gone further into the country to live, induced
to do so by the increased facilities for travelling that railways
have provided…. The same facilities have also
checked the influx of people to the same extent as formerly,
so that now in northern London people are flocking to
Hornsea and Hampstead and thereaway.”</p>

<p>The fact was that the metropolis had burst its boundaries,
and just as it had grown up around the “City” so now the
“outer ring,” as it was called, was growing up around it.</p>

<p>How little reliance could be placed on the intercensal
estimates of Medical Officers of Health as to the number of
inhabitants and the death-rate, is illustrated by the following
passage from the report of the Medical Officer of Health for
Islington in <span class="no-break">1891:—</span></p>

<p>“There was an error amounting to nearly 50,000 in the
estimated population of the parish in 1891; consequently all
statistics based on the estimated figures during the decade
1881–91 are more or less erroneous.”</p>

<p>Also “the mortality returns were not kept in such a
manner as to lead to accuracy, for while all deaths of non-residents
were excluded, the deaths of residents dying outside
the district in similar institutions were not included.</p>

<p>“It is impossible to make an accurate statement as to the
correct meaning of the mortality returns—the returns are
erroneous.”</p>

<p>A similar miscalculation was made by the Vestry of St.
George, Hanover Square. In their report for 1890–1 they
stated that they had no reason to believe that the population
was much different from what it was in 1871 and 1881.
The census, however, showed that it had fallen over 11,000.</p>

<p>In each successive census the number of inhabited houses
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
in London was enumerated. In this one the number was
547,120—being an increase of nearly 60,000; but not much
instruction was to be obtained from such general figures
beyond the fact that houses were becoming more and more
densely packed.</p>

<p>The substitution of blocks of dwellings for small houses
had also made considerable progress during the intercensal
period.<a id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>The same reasons as to the diminution of the number of
houses in the central parts of London continued to be given
by Medical Officers of Health.</p>

<p>In St. George-in-the-East it had been brought about “by
the extension of warehouses and the demolition of insanitary
property.” In St. Martin-in-the-Fields it was “due to
many former residents having removed to the country, and
to the demolition of so many houses for improvements.” In
the Strand to the fact that the district was becoming like all
the central parts of London, “a business, as distinguished
from a residential district.” The Vestry of St. James’
reported that “buildings formerly occupied as dwellings
were being replaced by warehouses and business premises
commanding a higher rent. As the centre of trade extends,
this condition of things must be expected to continue, just
as the increasing volume of trade has converted the City of
London at night from a populous place to little more than a
city of caretakers,” and they drew attention to the “enormous
number of people engaged in business in the parish during
the day time who resided elsewhere.”</p>

<p>On the south side of the river the same story was told.
The Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth remarking in
his report <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“The displacement of population from the central districts
of Lambeth, and the settlement of population in those
districts which are situated in the outer ring, or on the
circumference of the inner, is a part of a greater movement
which affects the whole metropolitan area.”</p>

<p>The census of 1891 is specially memorable by the fact
that for the first time a mass of most valuable information
was obtained which was wholly new, and which threw a
blaze of light upon the condition of the housing of the
population of London.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>
<p>For the first time full details were obtained and published
as to the numbers of the people living in tenements of less
than five rooms and the numbers and character of the tenements
they lived in.</p>

<p>A tenement was defined as “any house or part of a house
separately occupied either by the owner or by a tenant.”</p>

<p>These tenements were classified into those of one room,
two rooms, three rooms, and four rooms; and the number of
persons inhabiting each of these classes of tenements was
given.</p>

<p>The nearest approach to information of this sort had been
given by Mr. Marchant Williams in 1884, but it was only
for a particular area in London. The information now given
related to the whole of London.</p>

<p>The total number of tenements in London in 1891 was
stated to be 937,606.</p>

<p>Of these, 630,569 were tenements of less than five rooms.

<p class="p1">An examination of the detailed figures revealed some
astounding facts.</p>

<p>In the central group of parishes and districts, in the
parish of St. Luke 21,937 persons, or over one-half of the
population, lived in tenements of one or two rooms; in
Clerkenwell, over 33,000 persons; and in Holborn, over
16,000—practically one-half.</p>

<p>In the eastern group, in Whitechapel, close on 33,000
people, or over 44 per cent., lived in tenements of one or
two rooms. In Shoreditch, over 50,000, or 40 per cent.; in
Bethnal Green, 45,000 persons, or 38·4 per cent.; in St.
George-in-the-East, 43 per cent. of the population.</p>

<p>In the northern group, in St. Pancras 95,000, or over 40
per cent., lived in tenements of one or two rooms; and in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
one district of the Parish, namely Somerstown, 57 per cent.
of the population were living in such tenements. In St.
Marylebone over 58,000 lived in such tenements.</p>

<p>In the western group over 173,000 persons lived in tenements
of one or two rooms.</p>

<p>And on the south side of the Thames, in Bermondsey
close upon 24,000 lived in tenements of one or two rooms;
in Camberwell, 30,000; in Lambeth, 61,000; in Newington,
31,000; in St. Saviour over 41 per cent., and in St. George-the-Martyr
26,000, or over 43 per cent.</p>

<p>And examining the numbers of persons living in one-room
tenements, it appeared that in Chelsea one-tenth of the
population lived in such tenements; in St. Marylebone
somewhat less than a sixth; in Holborn a fifth; and in St.
George-in-the-East between a fourth and a fifth. These
figures show how large a proportion of the population began,
spent, and ended their existence within the four walls of a
single-room tenement.</p>

<p>The total result shown was that in the metropolis
1,063,000 persons, or one quarter of the population, lived in
one- or two-room tenements, and 1,250,000 in three- or four-room
tenements; making a total of over 2,310,000, or well
over half of the population living in tenements of less than
five rooms.</p>

<p>Of still deeper interest and import was the information
obtained as to that dreadful factor in London life—“overcrowding.”
An effort was now for the first time made to
get reliable information upon this matter. Hitherto it was
only by piecing together the statements made by some of the
Medical Officers of Health as to overcrowding in their
respective parishes that one could form even the crudest
idea of what the sum total in London actually amounted to.</p>

<p>Here, at last, was material enabling accurate calculations
to be made, not only of overcrowding in each separate
parish or district, but in London as a whole.</p>

<p>The Census Commissioners laid down the <span class="no-break">principle—</span></p>

<p>“That ordinary tenements which have more than two
occupants per room, bedrooms and sitting-rooms included,
may be considered as unduly overcrowded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>“We may,” they wrote, “be tolerably certain that the
rooms in tenements with less than five rooms will not in
any but exceptional cases be of large size, and that ordinary
tenements which have more than two occupants per room,
bedrooms and sitting-rooms included, may safely be considered
as unduly overcrowded.”</p>

<p>By using the information given in the tables, and excluding
all one-roomed tenements with not more than two
occupants, all two-roomed tenements with not more than
four occupants, all three-roomed tenements with not more
than six, and all four-roomed tenements with not more than
eight occupants, the desired information would be obtained.
And they <span class="no-break">added:—</span></p>

<p>“Each Sanitary Authority is now provided with the means
of examining with much precision into the house accommodation
of its district.”</p>

<p>Provided with the tables as to the occupants of tenements,
the Medical Officer of Health for the London County
Council, in his report for 1891, worked out the figures
for the metropolis. The result showed that there were in
London 145,513 tenements of less than five rooms apiece, in
each of which there were more than two inhabitants per
room, and each of which consequently was “overcrowded.”</p>

<p>But it is when one ascertains the number of persons
living in these overcrowded tenements that one realises
what the extent of overcrowding was. In round numbers,
one-fifth of the entire population of London lived in these
tenements. The total population was 4,200,000; the
number of “overcrowded” persons was 830,000.</p>

<p>A few illustrations of the overcrowding in certain parishes
brings the meaning of these figures home still more.</p>

<p>In Clerkenwell, 25,600 persons lived in overcrowded
tenements; in St. Luke, 18,700 persons; in Shoreditch,
41,700; in Islington, 64,600; in Kensington, 28,700; in
Lambeth, 43,600. The larger proportion of these lived
in one- or two-room tenements.</p>

<p>Figures are dry things to read and difficult to understand.
To appreciate the true meaning and import of these, and
to enable one who reads them to at all realise the conditions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
of existence of these hundreds of thousands of people, one
must recall to mind the descriptions given by many of the
Medical Officers of Health of tenement-houses; of all the
misery, the filth, the sickness, the physical and moral
degradation of life in tenement-rooms.</p>

<p>These facts now for the first time revealed the full
magnitude and momentous nature of the problem of the
sanitary housing of the people.</p>

<p>The year 1891 is memorable in the history of the sanitary
evolution of London for “the Public Health (London) Act,
1891,”<a id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> which consolidated and amended the laws then
existing in connection with the public health of the
metropolis.</p>

<p>The state of the law was recognised as very unsatisfactory,
being scattered over some thirty statutes or more—a condition
of things which was greatly to the disadvantage of
the public health of London.</p>

<p>Moreover, in accordance with the extraordinary custom,
London, which on account of its huge population needed
sanitary legislation almost more than any other place, had
been excepted from much sanitary legislation which had
been in operation for many years, with the most beneficial
results, in the remainder of the country. Part of this
legislation was at long last extended to London. Many
amendments were made, recommendations of the Royal
Commission of 1884 were given effect to, new provisions
introduced, and the general result was a Sanitary Code
for London—imperfect still in some important respects, but
a great advance on anything which London had previously
possessed.</p>

<p>The Act came into operation on the 1st of January, 1892,
and it applied to the Administrative County of London
only; some few of the provisions extending to the “City.”</p>

<p>And for the first time the new Central Authority—the
County Council—with extended powers, occupied a prominent
place in this legislation.</p>

<p>Once more did Parliament enact the oft-ignored direction
that “it shall be the duty of every sanitary authority to
cause to be made from time to time inspection of their
district” for detection of nuisances—a duty so shamelessly
neglected—and “to put in force the powers vested in them
relating to public health and local government so as to
secure the proper sanitary condition of all premises in their
district.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>With a view to secure fit and proper persons as Medical
Officers of Health and Sanitary Inspectors, their appointment
was made subject to the regulations of the Local Government
Board.</p>

<p>The Act greatly strengthened the law both as to the prevention
and definition of nuisances. It provided for the
immediate abatement of a nuisance, not only where actually
proved to be injurious or prejudicial to health, but also where
it was dangerous to health. It gave to any person the right
to give information of nuisances to the sanitary authority
instead of that right being limited to the person affected
by the nuisance; and it extended to a Sanitary Authority
the power to take proceedings for the abatement of nuisances
arising in the district of another authority should
the nuisance injuriously affect the inhabitants of their own
district. It transferred from the police to the local authority
the enforcement of the provisions of the law against smoke
nuisances. It dealt with the removal of refuse. It extended
the previous laws as to the adulteration of food and
drugs, and the inspection of articles intended for the food
of man. It enacted that a newly-erected dwelling-house
must not be occupied until a certificate had been obtained
of the Sanitary Authority to the effect that a proper and
sufficient supply of water exists; and made the provisions
as to the occupation of underground rooms as dwellings
more stringent and effective.</p>

<p>The notification and prevention of the infectious and
epidemic diseases, the provision of hospitals, ambulances,
and many other branches of the great subject—the health
of the public—were legislated upon. Additional duties
were imposed on the Sanitary Authority in the matter of
disinfection; the practical result of which was that the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
whole cost of disinfecting houses, and cleansing and disinfecting
bedding, clothing, &amp;c., was thrown upon the rates.
In several matters the option given in previous legislation
to local authorities to administer the law was taken away,
and the duty made imperative. Parliament evidently had
realised the hostility of many of the Vestries to administering
some of the principal provisions of sanitary law, and the
word “shall” figured much more frequently than ever
before.</p>

<p>The hitherto optional provision of mortuaries by the
sanitary authorities was made compulsory, the need for
suitable and convenient places for the reception of the dead
during the time that bodies are awaiting burial having long
been felt, particularly in the poorer districts, where bodies
awaiting burial were of necessity frequently kept in living
rooms under conditions dangerous to health, especially
where the case was an infectious one.</p>

<p>Among these “shalls” was that most important of all
health subjects—overcrowding—and the condition of the
tenement-houses of London. In this matter the local
authorities had through a quarter of a century been tried
in the balance and found wanting, and it was enacted
<span class="no-break">(Sec. 94):—</span></p>

<p>“Every Sanitary Authority <em>shall</em> make and enforce such
bye-laws as are requisite for the following matters (that
is to say): (<em>a</em>) for fixing the number of persons who may
inhabit a house, or part of a house, which is let in lodgings;
(<em>b</em>) for the registration of houses so let or occupied; (<em>c</em>) for
the inspection of such houses; … (<em>d</em>) for enforcing
drainage for such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and
ventilation in such houses; (<em>e</em>) for the cleansing and lime-washing
at stated times of the premises; (<em>f</em>) for the taking
of precautions in case of any infectious disease.”</p>

<p>In another matter, which the Vestries had long opposed,
their hostility was overborne. They were now required to
appoint “an adequate number of fit and proper persons as
sanitary inspectors,” and, in case of their failure to do so,
the Local Government Board was enabled, on the complaint
of the Council, to order the appointment of a proper number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>The new Central Authority, directly representative of the
whole of London, was not constituted the chief sanitary
authority for London, nor even a sanitary authority. It was
given power to make bye-laws for the prevention of nuisances
of various sorts in London, except as regarded the “City,”
to license cow-houses, and slaughter-houses, to appoint
Inspectors to inspect them, and also dairies and milkshops,
and it could extend the number of infectious diseases to
be notified.</p>

<p>But most important of all was the power given to the
County Council (by Section 100), which enacted, on it being
proved to the satisfaction of the Council, that any Sanitary
Authority (except the Commissioners of Sewers of the City)
had made default in doing their duty under this Act with
respect to the removal of any nuisance, the institution of
any proceedings, or the enforcement of any bye-laws, the
Council might institute any proceedings and do any act
which the Authority might have instituted and done, such
Authority being made liable to pay the Council’s expenses
in so doing.</p>

<p>And, furthermore, Section 101 provided that “when
complaint is made by the Council to the Local Government
Board that a Sanitary Authority have made default in
executing and enforcing any provision which it is their
duty to execute or enforce under the Act, or of any bye-law
made in pursuance thereof, the Local Government Board,
if satisfied after due inquiry that the Sanitary Authority
have been guilty of the alleged default, and that the complaint
cannot be remedied under the other provisions of
this Act, shall make an order limiting the time for the
performance of the duty of such authority in the matter
of such complaint. If such duty is not performed by the
time limited in the order, the order may be enforced by
writ of mandamus, or the Local Government Board may
appoint the Council to perform such duty,” and the expenses
were to be paid by the Sanitary Authority in default.</p>

<p>“It seems to me right and proper,” said Mr. Ritchie
in introducing the Bill, “that in regard to the great question
of public health in London the County Council ought to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
be charged with the performance of duty, which in the
opinion of the Local Government Board after inquiry, has
not been adequately and properly performed by the local
authority.”</p>

<p>These sections were strongly opposed by some of the
prominent Vestries, being held to be “degrading and
destructive of local self-government by completely subordinating
the local to the central authority.”</p>

<p>The self-government which many people like is the being
able to do exactly as they themselves like, regardless of
everybody else’s likes and rights. And it is the same
with many local government authorities. Their idea of
self-government too often is to govern for their own objects,
and their own interests, regardless of the infinitely greater
interests and rights of the great community around them;
and when it is brought home to them that they are only
a small integral part of a great community, that their sphere
of self-government can only be a very limited one, and that
they cannot be allowed either by action or neglect to injure
the community, they resent it with no little outcry.</p>

<p>The principle of self-government, however, was not one to
which appeal could be made, for it had been dragged through
the mire by too many of the local authorities. Once the
unity of London assumed definite shapes, as it did in the new
Central Authority representing the whole of London, Vestry
self-government, except upon certain lines and within certain
limitations, was doomed; for it would have to make way for
a far larger system of self-government—the self-government
of London by Londoners.</p>

<p>Moreover, prolonged experience had proved that the
Vestries could not be relied on to enforce the laws, and it
was manifest that some effective provision must be devised
for preventing them perpetually thwarting the intentions and
defeating the imperative enactments of Parliament designed
for the welfare of the community at large.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate, however, for the sanitary welfare of
great masses of the people of London that the principle thus
recognised and adopted by Parliament was not given fuller
effect to than it was, for it is the only principle upon which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
any really sound system of public health administration for
London can be based.</p>

<p>A few years later the principle was reaffirmed by Parliament.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1892 the appearance of cholera on
the west coast of Europe—particularly Hamburg—exposed
London to the importation of cases of this disease. The
unsatisfactory position of the Council with regard to London
administration for the prevention of epidemic disease was at
once made evident.</p>

<p>In order to remove doubts as to the Council’s responsibilities
as to the administration of the law relating to
epidemic diseases, a provision defining the Council’s position
was included in the Council’s General Powers Bill,
which was passed by Parliament in 1893. This provision
was to the following <span class="no-break">effect:—</span></p>

<p>“The Local Government Board may assign to the Council
any powers and duties under the epidemic regulations made
in pursuance of Section 134 of the Public Health Act, 1875,
which they may deem it desirable should be exercised and
performed by the Council.</p>

<p>“If the Local Government Board are of opinion that any
sanitary authority in whose default the Council has power
to proceed and act under the Public Health (London) Act,
1891, is making or is likely to make default in the execution
of the said regulations, they may by order assign to the
Council, for such time as may be specified in the order, such
powers and duties of the sanitary authority under the regulations
as they may think fit.”</p>

<p>Parliament thus once more emphasised the policy of the
local sanitary authorities being subordinated to the Central
Authority.</p>

<p>The new Central Authority—representative of the people
of London—gave early evidence of vitality and energy. The
heir had come into his property, with high ideals as to its
government, and as to the welfare of the people. A new
power had suddenly been brought into London life—an
unknown but vigorous force. A capable staff was at once
organised, and a Medical Officer and Assistant Medical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
Officer of Health appointed. Inquiries and investigations
into the various matters most concerning the welfare
of the citizens of London were at once undertaken, and
conclusions arrived at, and action taken, with a thoroughness
and a rapidity hitherto unknown in the administration
of London affairs.</p>

<p>Bye-laws were made to regulate and unify the administration
of sanitary laws by local authorities.</p>

<p>Several of the water companies were induced to give a
constant supply of water to an increased extent.</p>

<p>And great efforts were made to utilise the powers conferred
upon the Council by the recently passed Acts—the Housing
of the Working Classes Act of 1890, and the Public Health
(London) Act of 1891.</p>

<p>It was at once felt that the problem which first faced
the Council was the housing of the people, and the Council
determined to attack it on every side.</p>

<p>In the belief that facilities of communication between the
working centres of London and residences in healthier
localities would help considerably to alleviate some of the
worst effects of overcrowding, and towards the successful
treatment of the great housing problem, action was taken
to turn the Cheap Trains Act of 1883 to greater account,
and to secure greater numbers of workmen’s trains and
more moderate fares; so as to enable workmen to travel
cheaply between more distant homes and their places
of employment.</p>

<p>That Act, which gave a large remission in the amount
of passenger duty paid by railway companies, if the
companies would provide a service of workmen’s trains,
and would convey workmen at less than the usual fares,
had so far not been made much use of.</p>

<p>On investigation it was found that the facilities afforded
to workmen, particularly on certain railways, were very
inadequate. There were no workmen’s trains at all on
one important line—on another only one such train was
run, whilst on several others the number of trains run was
very small.</p>

<p>Representations were made to the Board of Trade and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
negotiations carried on with the Railway Companies, and
by degrees a considerable extension of the facilities for the
conveyance of workmen was secured.</p>

<p>The Council gave its immediate and more anxious
attention to those breeding-places and forcing-pits of
disease and misery, the insanitary areas in London.</p>

<p>The Housing Act of 1890 (by Part I.) constituted
the Council the authority for preparing and carrying into
effect schemes for the clearance and improvement of
insanitary areas which were of such size, and situation,
and character, as to render their clearance and reconstruction
of general importance to the County.</p>

<p>The tremendous task of dealing with them was rendered
more difficult and costly by the obligation imposed by
Parliament of providing housing accommodation for the
persons displaced; for in the lack of easy means of
communication with the outer parts of London it was
held to be necessary to re-house the greater number of them
in the same locality.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Board of Works had simply acquired
and cleared the properties, and disposed of the sites to
companies or individuals, placing on them the obligation
to erect houses for the working classes. Now, however,
the Council determined itself to erect, let, and maintain,
the necessary dwellings. The chief reason for the change
was the difficulty experienced in finding companies or
persons who were willing to undertake the erection of
dwellings on some of the sites.</p>

<p>The Council had to complete several schemes which it
inherited in an unfinished condition from the Metropolitan
Board of Works, but it at once initiated many itself, and
carried them through to a successful conclusion.</p>

<p>And as one after another of the insanitary areas was
investigated, so again and again was revealed to public
view the appalling condition in which thousands of people—in
the very heart of London—dragged out an existence
more bestial than human; horrors piled on horrors—a state
of things all the more awful because it had been existing
for an indefinite number of years—levying annually the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
heaviest of tolls on those who came within its deadly sphere,
and scattering its poison abroad among the community at
large.</p>

<p>There was the Clare Market (Strand) Scheme, some 3½
acres—3½ acres of human wretchedness and disease and
misery and filth. In one sub-area there were upwards
of 800 persons to the acre. Here the death-rate was 41·32
per 1,000 in 1894; in another sub-area, the death-rate had
been 50·52 per 1,000 in 1893; the death-rate for the whole
area having been 39·03 in 1894. And in addition to this
was the unknown sick-rate. There was the Webber Row
Scheme in St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark—close upon
5 acres in extent, with a death-rate of 30·5 per 1,000.
There were the Roby Street and Baltic Street areas in
St. Luke, areas which “have about the worst reputation
of any in London.”</p>

<p>The largest scheme which the Council undertook was
that known as “the Boundary Street Area” in Bethnal
Green. Here some fifteen acres of old, dilapidated, crowded
dwellings—dwellings so insanitary that the death-rate in
them was over 40 per 1,000—were swept away, entailing
the displacement of 5,719 persons; and the ground so cleared
was laid out with wider streets, and a large open space
and excellent buildings were erected thereon to contain
5,524 persons without crowding. The Prince of Wales
once more testified his deep interest in the welfare of the
poorer classes of London by opening the new buildings—a
ceremony which took place on the 3rd of March, 1900—and
delivering an impressive speech.</p>

<p>A summary of the work accomplished by the Council
up to this time showed that the Council had provided,
or was engaged in providing, accommodation for 35,950
persons at a total outlay of close upon £2,000,000, an
amount of building operations which, if conducted at
one spot, would have resulted in the formation of a town
of nearly 36,000 inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>
<p>The cost of this work was enormously heavy, owing to the
fact that the arbitrator could and did award commercial
value for the land; but, as was pointed out by the Medical
Officer of Health for the London County Council<a id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a><span class="no-break">:—</span></p>

<p>“The primary object of Part I. of the Act is not to
provide artizans’ dwellings, but to secure the removal from
the midst of the community of houses which are unfit for
habitation, and the faults of which are in large degree due
to bad arrangement. Where houses are thus situated, and
are in a number of ownerships, rearrangement can only be
carried out by vesting the property in one ownership, that
of a public authority, who can then, by the making of new
streets and by complete rearrangement of the area, ensure
that the conditions which in future will exist are such as are
needed for the health of the inhabitants. The chief value of
the Act is, therefore, not so much the provision of house
accommodation which is fit for habitation, as the abolition
of houses which are dangerous to health. Part I. is not,
therefore, in itself so much a Housing Act as an Act for the
removal of nuisances on a large scale.”</p>

<p>But another reflection also suggests itself, namely, why
should the ratepayers of London have been obliged to pay
these high sums for property which, by the culpable neglect
of the owners and their predecessors, had been allowed to
sink into a condition not alone exceptionally dangerous
to the lives of its inhabitants, but a constant danger to
neighbouring districts—even to London itself. Surely in
common fairness, those who had let it fall into such a state
should have paid the penalty therefor, and not the public of
London, who had had no part in bringing the property into
such an evil condition.</p>

<p>Part II. of the Act was mostly a consolidation of Torrens’
Acts, 1868 and 1882, with amendments. It enabled the
Vestries or District Boards to take proceedings before a
magistrate for the clearing and demolition of single houses
unfit for human habitation, and obstructive buildings, and
empowered them and the County Council to undertake
schemes for the improvement of areas too small to be
dealt with by the Council.</p>

<p>The owner might elect to retain the site after the demolition
of the building, and in that case received compensation
for the building only. If the Vestry or District Board
acquired the site the same procedure as to compensation
had to be followed as under Part I.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>
<p>A few schemes were undertaken by Vestries under this
Part of the Act, the Council making a contribution to the
cost, and a few by the Council. Thus in St. George-in-the-East,
from November, 1890, to the end of 1894, 224
houses were “represented” as unfit for habitation—gruesome
pictures of dirt, dilapidation, and insanitation of every
form and variety, and this, too, after nearly forty years of
sanitary work by the Vestry. Many were closed by order
of the magistrate, some by the owner, some pulled down,
some repaired and re-let.</p>

<p>Part III. of the Act embodied the idea, originally started
by Lord Shaftesbury in 1851, as to the erection of labouring
classes’ lodging-houses by the local authorities, and grafted
several amendments thereon.</p>

<p>Power was given for the acquisition by the Council of
land for the purpose of erecting lodging-houses thereon.
Such land, however, was to be within the Council’s jurisdiction.
Under this part of the Act the Council erected a
common lodging-house in Parker Street for the accommodation
of over 300 persons. It also acquired several sites,
including the Millbank estate, upon which it proceeded to
build houses; and one of 38 acres at Lower Tooting for the
erection of cottages thereon.</p>

<p>Altogether the work performed under the Act was
considerable, and the housing for the accommodation of
the working classes made sensible progress, the sites sold
by the Metropolitan Board of Works to trusts, and public
companies, and private persons, having been built upon and
covered with artizans’ dwellings.</p>

<p>Private building was proceeding at considerable pace, and
in many parts of London the ground was becoming more
overcrowded than ever with houses.</p>

<p>The older parts of London were being rapidly re-built,
and open spaces at the rear of buildings were being gradually
covered by buildings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>Of St. Pancras the Medical Officer of Health wrote
<span class="no-break">(1896):—</span></p>

<p>“… There is a prospect that in course of time the
whole of the open space about buildings may disappear….
Old houses possessing yards, areas, open spaces, in some
form at the front or back or both, are being re-built in
such a manner as to entirely cover the whole ground area
two or three storeys up—leaving not a particle of open
space.”</p>

<p>The restrictions imposed by the Building Acts were of
the most illusory character, and as the Acts were mostly
future in their operation, and not retrospective, their effect
was also limited. Any “owner” was entitled to re-build on
“old foundations,” no matter how crowded the houses were
on the spot, so new buildings were usually only a resurrection
in huger and more perpetual and objectionable form of
the evils which ought, as far as possible, to have been
eradicated.</p>

<p>During the year 1894 the London Building Law was
consolidated and amended. The Act recognised, for the
first time in London, the principle that, in addition to
the height of the building being proportionate to the width
of the street on which it abuts, the amount of open space
about the rear of a building should also be proportionate to
its height, and hence the future crowding of buildings on
area was put under limitation.</p>

<p>But how small was the limitation, how small the concessions
exacted from “owners” in this matter, and how
miserably late they came in the history of London building
operations.</p>

<p>The tendency of house construction in London was to
ever larger size, to greater height. To how great an extent
this had been carried on in the “City” was described by
the Medical Officer of Health in <span class="no-break">1894:—</span></p>

<p>“It would be a fair and moderate estimate to put the
superficial area (of the City) at <em>four square miles</em> instead of
one. We have only to point to the construction of business
premises—the piling of one floor over another for many
storeys high, each floor being occupied by separate occupiers,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
forming in itself a distinct tenancy, having all the rights
and privileges of an independent building, and claiming as
much attention from every branch of our municipal system
as if it stood alone…. We have, in fact, to deal with about
28,000 separate tenancies, with a day population of 301,384.”</p>

<p>In some of the more well-to-do parts of the metropolis
great blocks of buildings were built and let out in flats,
most of them with the minimum of light and air prescribed
by narrow laws.</p>

<p>In other districts of London considerable numbers of
small houses were removed, and large blocks of artizans’
dwellings erected in their stead. Thus, in the parish of
St. Luke, nearly one-fifth of the entire population resided
in the ten blocks of artizans’ dwellings which existed there.</p>

<p>In the earlier stages of the reform of the housing of
London such buildings had been acclaimed as great
improvements, as indeed they were. The later opinions
of Medical Officers of Health were not so laudatory. Thus,
in 1891, the Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel,
after stating that there were in his district 27 buildings
having 3,127 apartments containing 12,279 persons, added
that he was “not enlisted amongst the enthusiasts of this
method of providing for the housing of the working classes.”
In 1896 he wrote: “All model dwellings are not equally
models of good sanitary houses.” And in <span class="no-break">1897:—</span></p>

<p>“The increased population are housed in huge barrack
buildings which sometimes are constructed so as to allow
light and air to permeate the rooms and sometimes not.
The effect of this modern invention is to increase the
density of population to a damaging degree….</p>

<p>“That the direct influence of these barrack buildings
upon the health of their occupants—more especially the
children—is adverse, I have not the slightest doubt.”</p>

<p>The Vestry of Shoreditch reported in <span class="no-break">1892–3:—</span></p>

<p>“‘Model Artizans’ Dwellings’ do not appear to have been
quite what their title implied. At Norfolk Buildings, Shoreditch,
on the Medical Officer of Health causing them to be
examined for a certificate for exemption from the inhabited
house duty, the whole system of drainage was found to be in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
a most defective and dangerous state. A number of cases of
typhoid, diphtheria, and other infectious illness had occurred
on the premises.”</p>

<p>And a couple of years later the Chief Sanitary Inspector
submitted to his Vestry a report on some so-called “model
dwellings”: “These blocks of buildings, 50 feet high, are
packed together so as to exclude light and air, and four
rooms occupy the site of two: evil conditions which the
architect and owner were not only privileged to create, but
also, and very practically, in so doing were they privileged
to condemn unborn generations of people, whose necessities
condemn them to live in these tenements, to endure the evils
of their creation.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. James’ <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Block dwellings in such an area as St. James’ do not
provide the conditions in which healthy children can be
reared, nor in which there can be a family life comparable
with that possible in the open suburbs of London.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Olave gave a
description of Barnham <span class="no-break">Buildings:—</span></p>

<p>“Many of the rooms, &amp;c., on the ground and first floor
are generally very dark, and the buildings have not been
maintained in a sanitary condition, notwithstanding the
hundreds of notices that have been served the past five
years. The average death-rate of the past five years of the
unhealthy tenements was at least 49·6 per 1,000 and of the
remainder at least 29·1.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. Marylebone gave
an interesting explanation of the condition of this class of
<span class="no-break">houses:—</span></p>

<p>“The following is a list of applications, under the
Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1891, from which it
will be gathered that it is quite exceptional for a block
of artizans’ dwellings of even recent construction to be in
a tolerable sanitary condition. The reason for this anomalous
state of things is, that in the building of these dwellings
the Sanitary Authority seems to have no power; a dwelling
must be occupied before it comes under supervision.”</p>

<p>In spite of these and many other drawbacks, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
many of these buildings afforded accommodation far superior
to that which had previously existed on the spots where
they were erected, and provided residence for large numbers
of people who otherwise might have been doomed to living
in the worst class of tenement-house.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the Public Health Act of 1891
was another Act passed in the same year—“The Factory and
Workshop Act.”</p>

<p>The Select Committee of the House of Lords on the
Sweating System had finished their inquiry and reported
in 1890. The evidence given before it was, as regarded
factories, workshops, and workplaces, very much a
repetition of that which for thirty-five years had been
detailed by Medical Officers of Health as regarded the
dwellings of the people, but now obtaining greater publicity
attracted more attention.</p>

<p>Overcrowding and insanitation of almost every conceivable
kind pursued large numbers of the unfortunate
workers from their overcrowded and insanitary tenements
to their overcrowded and insanitary workplaces, and with
the same disastrous results. And as regarded domestic
workshops the conditions were even worse, workers
spending their days and nights often in the one room—sometimes
with extra workers brought in.</p>

<p>Want of light and air and overcrowding in workshops
and factories are quite as serious matters as they are in
inhabited houses.</p>

<p>The Select Committee, in their conclusions and recommendations,
<span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“The sanitary conditions under which the work is
conducted are not only injurious to the health of the
persons employed, but are dangerous to the public,
especially in the case of the trades concerned in making
clothes, as infectious diseases are spread by the sale of
garments made in rooms inhabited by persons suffering
from smallpox and other diseases. Three or four gas
jets may be flaring in the room, a coke fire burning in
the wretched fireplace, sinks untrapped, closets without
water, and altogether the sanitary condition abominable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>“A witness told us that in a double room, perhaps
nine by fifteen feet, a man, his wife, and six children
slept, and in the same room ten men were usually
employed, so that at night eighteen persons would be in
that one room.”</p>

<p>“In nine cases out of ten the windows are broken
and filled up with canvas; ventilation is impossible and
light insufficient—the workshops are miserable dens.
We are of opinion that all workplaces included in the
above description should be required to be kept in a
cleanly state, to be lime-washed or washed throughout
at stated intervals, to be kept free from noxious effluvia,
and not to be overcrowded—in other words, to be treated
for sanitary purposes as factories are treated under the
factory law.”</p>

<p>Lord Kenry, Chairman of the Committee, in his draft
report, <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“It has been shown that the dwellings or shops in
which the sweated class live and work are too often places
in which all the conditions of health, comfort, and decency
are violated or ignored…. Sanitary inspection is totally
inadequate, and the local bodies have seldom done their
duty effectually. At the East End of London generally
the sanitary state of homes and shops could not possibly
be much worse than it is.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Lakeman (Government Inspector under the
Factories and Workshops Act) said, in reference to workshops:
“I think that the evidence given your Lordships
upon the insanitary state of those places is not at all
too black.”</p>

<p>Once more the necessity of inspection was insisted upon.
“On no point,” wrote the Chairman, “was the unanimity
of witnesses more emphatic than with reference to the
necessity of more efficient sanitary inspection, not only of
workshops, but of the dwellings of the poor.”</p>

<p>And just as it was as regarded tenement-houses, inspection
here was lamentably deficient, if not absolutely
non-existent.</p>

<p>“The inspection at present carried on is totally inadequate,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
and nothing was more clearly proved before us
than the fact that satisfactory results cannot be looked for
from the system as it now stands.”<a id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>“Even when an unmistakable cause of unhealthiness is
discovered, and steps are taken to remove it, the process
of applying the remedy is slow and uncertain. The Local
Board meets once a week or fortnight … the landlord
is allowed a fortnight to carry out the work; three weeks
may elapse before the inspector can go and see it, then
perhaps nothing has been done; the summons, &amp;c., takes
time. In any case much valuable time is lost, and smallpox
or fever is allowed to pursue its ravages with the
source of the disease daily aggravated in intensity.</p>

<p>“At present the inspectors under the Factory and Workshop
Act of 1878 have no power to deal with any nuisance
which lies within the district over which the local authorities
preside. On the other hand, the local inspector cannot
interfere should he discover any breach of the Factory
Act.”</p>

<p>The Home Secretary, in moving the second reading of
the Bill, explained its scope. He <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“The design and object of this Bill is to bring all workshops
and all factories up to the same sanitary level, and to
require the same conditions as to ventilation, overcrowding,
lime-washing, and cleanliness to be applied to all kinds
of workshops in which men alone, or women, children, and
young persons are employed. The Bill does not deal with
‘domestic workshops.’ The President of the Local
Government Board will introduce a Bill dealing with the
public health, and the House may rest content with
leaving what is called ‘the domestic workshop’—that is
to say, the working-man’s home in which he works with
the members of his family—subject to the provisions of
the law of public health alone. It is obvious that in the
domestic workshop you have not got the presence of the
employer and the employé. You have the members of
the same family … and it seems to me that we may
allow him and his family to work in a place which is
sufficiently good so far as sanitary conditions are concerned
for him and his family to live in. Now that we are
extending the sanitary provisions of the Factory Act to all
workshops throughout the country, of whatever kind they
may be except the domestic workshop, so that every
cobbler’s shop, every blacksmith’s shop, every tailor’s shop,
will come under the provisions of the sanitary law, it
seems to me foolish not to take advantage of the existing
machinery provided by the local authorities, and the
enforcement of the sanitary provisions, so far as workshops
are concerned, is by this Bill given to the local authorities.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>
<p>The passing of the Factory and Workshops Act (1891)
and of the Public Health (London) Act of 1891 made the
sanitary authorities primarily responsible for enforcing
many new provisions. Those authorities were charged
with the duty of securing the maintenance of the “workshops”
in a sanitary condition, of preventing overcrowding
in them, and of enforcing cleanliness, ventilation, lime-washing,
and freedom from effluvia, and securing the
provision of sufficient sanitary accommodation.</p>

<p>Added to this was the sanitary supervision of the places
of “outworkers.”<a id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>It would appear, however, that only in exceptional
instances was any systematic attempt made in 1892 to carry
out the new duties imposed by the Legislature upon the
Vestries and District Boards.</p>

<p>In several instances the Medical Officers of Health drew
attention to the impossibility of undertaking workshop
inspection with their existing staff. Thus the Medical
Officer of Health of <span class="no-break">Hackney:—</span></p>

<p>“Inquiry has revealed the presence of something like
2,000 workshops and dwellings of outworkers which, under
this Act and Order, should be inspected to ascertain the
presence or otherwise of any insanitary condition. With
the present staff it is impossible that this can be
attempted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>In St. Marylebone the Medical Officer of Health stated,
in 1894, that the number of workshops and workplaces
in his parish amounted to 3,550. And in 1895 he wrote:
“The workplaces are so numerous in the parish that it is
not practicable for them all to be inspected regularly with
the present staff.”</p>

<p>“Increased duties,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health
for Fulham in 1893, “having been placed on the sanitary
staff by the ‘Factory and Workshop Act’ of 1891, relating
to outworkers; but with the existing number of inspectors
it is not possible to attend to them thoroughly, so that the
Act in Fulham is almost ‘a dead letter.’”</p>

<p>“In Islington,” reported the Medical Officer of Health in
1895, “neither the factories nor workshops in the district,
nor the smoke nuisances receive any attention worth
mentioning, and so far as this district is concerned they
may be said to have been entirely neglected.</p>

<p>“I look upon the inspection of factories and workshops as
one of the greatest necessities of the present day, not only
from a health point of view, but also from the social
aspect.”</p>

<p>The manifest solution of this difficulty was the appointment
of additional inspectors, but the local authorities
had a sort of horror of such appointments, though by this
time they must have known that the benefit to workers and
to the community generally would have been very great.</p>

<p>A report in 1892 of the Medical Officer of Health of
St. George-the-Martyr shows the grievous need there
was for inspection of one very important class of
<span class="no-break">workshop:—</span></p>

<p>“I have inspected sixty-three retail bakehouses within
the parish, and found them (with few exceptions) to be
in a filthy and unwholesome state, dangerous alike to
the health of the journeyman baker, who makes the
bread, and to the public who eat it. Twenty-one were
completely underground…. In times of heavy rainfall
sewage forces itself through the draintraps of these cellars,
soiling the sacks containing flour, and fouling the
atmosphere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>Parliament again legislated about factories and workshops
in 1895.</p>

<p>Under the Act a minimum space was required in each
room of a factory or workshop of 250 cubic feet for each
person employed. For the prevention of the infection
of clothing, the occupier of a factory, &amp;c., was prohibited
from causing wearing apparel to be made or cleaned
in a dwelling-house having an inmate suffering from
scarlet fever or smallpox. An important step was also
taken in extending the provisions of the Factory Acts to
laundries, of which there were a great number in London,
and where the workers stood in great need of improved
conditions of work, and of public supervision.</p>

<p>Lamentable as were the results of the non-protection of
the workers in workshops, still more lamentable and disastrous
were they as regarded the 2,310,000 dwellers in the
630,569 tenements of less than five rooms. Up to 1889
regulations under the Sanitary Acts of 1866 and 1874 had
been adopted in 31 of the 40 London sanitary districts. In
only nine of these was any considerable use made of them.
Had these regulations been put into force a great amount of
overcrowding would have been prevented and the houses
kept in a fairly clean and sanitary condition.</p>

<p>In the whole of London, with its 547,000 houses, only
7,713 tenement-houses were on the register in 1897, of
which more than a half were in four parishes, namely: 1,500
in Kensington, 1,190 in Westminster, 840 in Hampstead,
and 610 in St. Giles’; leaving 3,573 in the whole of the
rest of London—a mere fraction of the tenement-houses of
London.</p>

<p>In Bethnal Green (1894), “76·1 per cent. of the population lived in
tenements of less than five rooms. No houses had been
registered.”</p>

<p>In Lambeth over one-half of the population lived in tenements
of less than five rooms, and of these nearly one-third
lived under conditions of overcrowding. There was one
Sanitary Inspector to about 60,000 people. The inadequacy
of the staff had been pressed upon the Vestry by the Medical
Officer of Health from time to time for a number of years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>Considerable ingenuity was in many cases exercised by the
opponents of the regulation of tenements in the working of
the bye-laws which resulted practically in rendering them
inoperative. In some cases all houses were to be exempted
where the rent was higher than certain specified weekly
sums. The result was that the “owners” promptly raised
the rent above these sums, and so secured their exemption,
at the same time getting an increased rent. In others, the
bye-laws gave the Vestry power to decide what houses
should be registered, and thus enabled the Vestry to evade
the necessity of registering any at all. In others, notices
were to be given to the “owner” before a house was
registered—the notice was not sent. And so, in one way
or another, the imperative “shall” of Parliament was
evaded by the largest proportion of the Vestries and District
Boards.</p>

<p>As regarded the Vestries and District Boards who made a
show of putting the regulations in force, the Medical
Officers explained that, owing to the inadequacy of the staff
of Sanitary Inspectors, it was “impossible” to inspect the
houses regularly.</p>

<p>In other parishes and districts the number registered and
inspected was but a fraction of the houses which ought to
have been registered. In Bow (in Poplar) where none were
registered, the Medical Officer of Health wrote in 1891: “I
should say 4,000 houses require registration.” In St. Mary,
Newington: “At least 80 per cent. of the houses are occupied
by members of more than one family.” But as yet
none were registered. And this same Medical Officer of
Health pointed out how in his parish—“The indisposition
that has hitherto been shown on the part of the Vestry to
put into force the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings has led
to great license in house-farming and house-crowding.”</p>

<p>Where really put into operation the regulations had an
excellent effect. Thus the District Board of St. Giles’
said: “The advantage of these regulations has been very
great.”</p>

<p>And in Paddington the Medical Officer of Health stated:
“The work done … has had an excellent effect.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Of some streets where houses were registered (1897–8)—“The
whitewashing and cleansing has without doubt
had a good effect. The streets have been freer from
infectious diseases than they have been for several years
past.”</p>

<p>The advantages of the regulations in the administration
of the health laws were time after time pointed out and
insisted upon by many Medical Officers of Health.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Westminster, where
nearly 1,000 houses were registered, wrote (1899):—</p>

<p>“The great advantage in legal procedure lies in the fact
that a breach of them is a finable offence with a further
daily penalty after written notice, and is not a nuisance subject
to abatement within a certain time.</p>

<p>“If the conditions imposed by the bye-laws are carried
out, no doubt one of the best methods for preventing overcrowding
is thus achieved.”</p>

<p>The advantage of this quicker procedure was manifest, for,
under the other Public Health or Sanitary Acts, the whole
process of dealing with, or getting a nuisance abated, took
“a long time—a very long time,” but the advantages did
not appeal to people who did not want to use them.</p>

<p>Thus there was a most grievous neglect of duty on the
part of the great majority of the Vestries and District
Boards, with the inevitable result of the most disastrous
consequences to the working and poorer classes all over
London.</p>

<p>It must have appeared strange, in view of this glaring
and scandalous neglect of duty by the Vestries in enforcing
the regulations, that the London County Council as the
Central Authority did not use the powers which they were
supposed to possess of acting in the default of the local authorities,
or of making representation to the Local Government
Board of the neglect of those authorities.</p>

<p>The explanation was, that in the administration of this,
absolutely the most important of all branches of the housing
problem of London, the London County Council, had been
left entirely out—had not even been given a voice in the
framing of the bye-laws or regulations, and therefore had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
no legal power to act. Regulations or bye-laws, drafted by
the Local Government Board as “models” for adoption by
the local authorities, suggested “exemptions” to what Parliament
had directed—though there was not a single word
in the 94th Section or in any part of the Act to justify
such a suggestion—or suggested phrases in them which
actually placed the enforcement or non-enforcement of
the Act in the discretion of those authorities, this, too,
though Parliament had made the explicit imperative enactment
that these local authorities should make and enforce
regulations.</p>

<p>Most of the Vestries made bye-laws under Section 94 of
the Act, nearly all containing exemption or elusive clauses
as suggested; some even avowedly reserving to themselves
the option of registering or not registering houses, as they
thought fit.</p>

<p>The London County Council was not in a position to act
in their default, as these authorities could shelter themselves
under the option contained in the terms of the
regulations, and a representation to the Local Government
Board would have been useless, as the same defence would
be effectively made by the local authorities if called to
account.</p>

<p>Thus, the deliberate enactment of Parliament was frustrated;
the Act was prevented being a remedy for overcrowding,
or even a protection against it, and except in a
few parishes or districts where the great advantages of the
Act were appreciated, all the dreadful evils of overcrowding
were given free play, and allowed to flourish on as gigantic
a scale as ever.</p>

<p>The effects of the inaction of the Vestries and District
Boards were unfortunately not confined to the moment. A
legacy of suffering, of misery, and physical deterioration
was left to subsequent generations. Once more might
hundreds of thousands of voices of the victims and sufferers
have cried out: “While you remain inactive, death and
disease do not.”<a id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>
<p>A special census of the population of London was taken
on March 29, 1896, which showed that the population
had increased to 4,443,018 persons, being an increase
of 200,900; and the number of inhabited houses from
547,120 to 553,119.</p>

<p>As years had gone by, and the necessity and importance
of sanitation had become more widely recognised, and as
London had grown in size and increased in population, the
duties of the Vestries had grown heavier, and the tendency
of legislation was to broaden the basis of their action.</p>

<p>The mileage of public streets to be paved, lighted, cleansed,
and watered, had multiplied two, three, and four times since
1855; the number of houses in many districts had more
than doubled; the drainage work had increased proportionally;
the scavenging and removing of refuse also. Nominal
duties had become real ones, and new duties had been
added—the disinfection of infected houses and infected
clothes, the inspection of food, the working of the Food
and Drugs Act—these, with numerous smaller matters,
meant a very considerable amount of work, expense, and
responsibility.</p>

<p>But all these were what one of the Vestries in their
Report described as “well-worn grooves of familiar routine.”
In addition thereto, and now more than ever of primary importance,
was the great duty of inspection—inspection of
houses, and of rooms in houses, and of workshops, and often
the consequent proceedings for the abatement of nuisances,
or the punishment of offenders.</p>

<p>“House-to-house inspection,” wrote the Medical Officer
of Health for Islington in 1893, “is the only efficient
remedy for extensive sanitary evils. It is the life and soul
of sanitary work.”</p>

<p>House-to-house inspection of their districts was the
most necessary of all sanitary work—as it was the means by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>which most sanitary defects and malpractices were detected—but
it was the first to be sacrificed under the increased
pressure of work, and the last for which adequate provision
was made.</p>

<p>“A house-to-house inspection has been attempted more
than once,” wrote the Medical Officer of Health for Islington
in 1893, “but it has never yet been brought to a complete
and satisfactory finish.”</p>

<p>In fact the main breakdown of the Vestry administration
in London was their antipathy to inspection, and their
refusal to appoint a sufficient number of inspectors.</p>

<p>“The subject of overcrowding alone,” wrote one Medical
Officer of Health, “if properly attended to, would pretty
well occupy the whole of the time of the present staff.”</p>

<p>The complaints of the Medical Officers of Health were
frequent and insistent on the inadequacy of the inspectorate.
Thus the Medical Officer of Health for Fulham
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The Vestry must clearly understand that the present
staff of Sanitary Inspectors is quite inadequate to properly
perform the duties devolving upon the Sanitary Authority.
There is only one Sanitary Inspector to every 35,000 inhabitants.
Should the Vestry persist in their refusal to employ
an adequate staff, the inference will be unavoidable that
they are unwilling that the Acts—for the faithful administration
of which, in the interests of the public health, they
as Sanitary Authority are responsible—should be properly
carried out.”</p>

<p>Interesting light is often to be found in the reports sometimes
of the Vestries, and oftener of the Medical Officers
of Health, upon various aspects of the great housing
problem.</p>

<p>Sometimes a sentence enables so much else to be understood.
Thus, in 1892, a Medical Officer of Health <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Many persons think the Public Health Act an innovation
on their privileges.”</p>

<p>Describing the insanitary condition of 230 houses in
Provost Street, Shoreditch, the Sanitary Inspector wrote
in <span class="no-break">1892:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>“The difficulty of dealing with these houses has been
greatly increased by the circumstance that the leases will
expire in a very few years. There was, therefore, a very
natural objection on the part of many of the leaseholders to
execute substantial works, of which the freeholder would in
a few years reap the benefit, and without contributing anything
to the expense of the improvements.”</p>

<p>This “very natural objection” entailed, of necessity, sickness
and death upon a considerable number of persons.</p>

<p>The Vestry of St. Pancras wrote in <span class="no-break">1893:—</span></p>

<p>“The primary cause of houses and buildings becoming
insanitary is the neglect of freeholders to compel lessees
to comply with the terms and conditions of their leases. If
the Vestry were empowered (where freeholders are negligent)
to compel freeholders to cause lessees to carry into
effect the covenants of the leases, the houses inhabited by
the poorer classes would not become so wretchedly dilapidated
and a scandal, but might be maintained in a fairly
habitable condition.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Bethnal Green exonerated
some property owners, whilst fixing the blame on others.</p>

<p>“… As a rule it is the professional insanitary property
owner who has to be summoned time after time, and who exhausts
every technicality and raises every possible objection,
well knowing that in the usual way only an order costing some
few shillings will be made against him.”</p>

<p>Others, however, went further. The Medical Officer of
Health for Islington wrote in <span class="no-break">1893:—</span></p>

<p>“Since 1891 there has been a steady forward movement,
and … one now constantly hears of the persecution of the
‘poor property owner.’</p>

<p>“That owner who for long years had everything his own
way, and who did as little as he could to make things healthy
for his tenants, knowing well that there were plenty of persons
ready to occupy any or every house. Property has
rights, but so has flesh and blood; and if it be right that
property should be protected from unnecessary exactions, it
is surely righteous that the health and lives of human beings
should be safeguarded in every way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>And in the following year, writing about some insanitary
bakehouses, he said: “It has always seemed to me a very
absurd argument that because a place has been allowed to
be occupied for a long series of years to the detriment of the
health of the people working therein that therefore it must
not be now abolished.</p>

<p>“If those insanitary places have been occupied for such a
long time, surely they have more than recouped their owners
for the money that has been originally spent on their
erection?”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for St. James’, after twenty-five
years’ work as Medical Officer of Health, declared in
<span class="no-break">1898:—</span></p>

<p>“The only practical course is to saddle the landlord with
full responsibility for the neglect or misconduct of the
tenants whom he harbours, at large rents, for his own
profit.”</p>

<p>In 1894 Parliament passed “The Local Government (England
and Wales) Act,” which included London in its scope,
and which introduced great changes as to the electorate, the
mode of election, and the qualification of vestrymen.</p>

<p>A new electorate on almost the widest basis was
created, all persons, male or female, on the Parliamentary
or County Council Register, including lodgers and service
voters, and married women, who were themselves tenants
of property, being made parochial electors; and the Vestry
was to be elected under the provisions of the Ballot Act
of 1872.</p>

<p>Thus the scandals hitherto associated with Vestry elections
were for the future obviated, and greater publicity—that
safeguard of all public bodies—was assured.</p>

<p>Additional powers were also obtainable under the Act by
the Vestries on application to the Local Government Board,
who could transfer to the Vestry the powers and properties
of the Library Commissioners, the Baths Commissioners,
and the Burial Board; the power of appointing the Overseers
of the Poor, and some other powers and duties of more
or less importance, possessed or possessable by Parish Councils.
The elections were held on December 15, 1894.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>The new Vestries, however, did not mend the ways of
their predecessors as regarded “inspection.”</p>

<p>Of Bethnal Green the Chief Sanitary Inspector said
(1897): “With the existing staff (five Inspectors) and having
regard to other work, it would take five years to visit all the
houses in the parish—about 17,000.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Kensington wrote
(1898): “The staff is quite inadequate for the discharge
of the duties devolving upon your Vestry as Sanitary
Authority.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Hammersmith wrote
in 1899: “The house-to-house inspection of the district is
now nearly completed, and has taken six years to accomplish.
The result of the inspection is in the highest degree
satisfactory … nevertheless it cannot be contended that
inspecting the district once in six years is properly carrying
out the 1st Section of the Public Health (London) Act,
1891.”</p>

<p>A series of investigations was made by the Medical Officer
of Health of the London County Council, or by his assistant,
into the sanitary condition of various parishes or districts,
and an instructive light thrown upon the administration
of their affairs by their respective local governing
authorities.</p>

<p>Almost uniformly, so far as they were concerned, it was
found that bye-laws as to houses let in lodgings were not
enforced, and no, or practically no inspection of workshops,
of which there were thousands, nor of “outworkers” had
been carried out, and that the sanitary staff was quite
inadequate for the work.</p>

<p>Though much was thus most unsatisfactory, yet in
many other important matters which vitally affected the
public health, considerable progress was being made.</p>

<p>In the matter of water supply a steady but slow improvement
had, under public pressure, taken place. In 1892 a
Royal Commission was appointed to inquire as to whether
the existing sources of supply were adequate, and it reported
in the following year.</p>

<p>“We are strongly of opinion,” they said, “that the water as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
supplied to the consumer in London is of a very high standard
of excellence and of purity, and that it is suitable in quality
for all household purposes. We are well aware that a certain
prejudice exists against the use of drinking water derived
from the Thames and the Lea, because these rivers are
liable to pollution, however perfect the subsequent purification
by natural or artificial means may be; but having
regard to the experience of London during the last thirty
years, and to the evidence given us on the subject, we do not
believe that any danger exists of the spread of disease by the
use of this water, provided that there is adequate storage,
and that the water is efficiently filtered before delivery to
the consumers.”</p>

<p>This statement was to a certain extent satisfactory, but
the fact remained that both the Thames and Lea still
received sewage effluents above the intakes, and considerable
pollution from other causes; and that diseases might
still be water-borne and water-distributed by them. The
thoroughness of the filtration also was often open to doubt.</p>

<p>Improvement was gradually being effected in the system
of removal or disposal of filth and refuse of all sorts and
kinds; the sweepings of the streets, the refuse from houses.
According to the general practice of the local authorities the
great bulk of this stuff was first brought to yards or places,
the property of the authorities, and there sorted or sifted
and sent down the river or along the canals in barges, or
sometimes even by rail to the country. But the system was
costly and insanitary and inefficient, and as was pointed out—“it
could not be deemed satisfactory when large metropolitan
districts inflict their filth upon smaller communities
in urban districts.”</p>

<p>A system of destroying much of this filth by fire had been
devised, and gradually was adopted by the local authorities.
It was found that with a properly constructed and efficient
destructor no nuisance need result, and this method of disposing
of house refuse was much more desirable from a
sanitary point of view than that usually adopted by London
Sanitary Authorities.</p>

<p>A certain number of local authorities adopted this method
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
to the great advantage of the community, and though there
is still much to be done in this direction, the change, so far
as it has gone, has undoubtedly minimised a great evil.</p>

<p>Both numerous and various are the measures which have
to be taken for the protection of the public from disease.
One of the most essential of these was disinfection—the
disinfection of rooms where there had been infectious
or contagious disease, and the disinfection or destruction
of clothing or articles used by the person suffering from
the disease. The process of disinfection originally was of the
most primitive character and doubtful efficacy, but the
progress of science had elaborated really effective methods.</p>

<p>In 1866 the local authorities had been given power to
provide a proper place with all necessary apparatus, &amp;c.,
for the disinfection of infected clothing, &amp;c., free of charge,
and to give compensation for articles destroyed. Thus every
inducement was given to the public to get infected articles
disinfected. But many years were to pass before provision
by the Vestries was extensively made.</p>

<p>By the Public Health London Act, 1891, this provision
was made imperative on the local authorities.</p>

<p>Disinfection by steam was considered practically the only
efficient system. By 1895 twenty-four sanitary authorities
had provided themselves with this apparatus, six with an
apparatus whereby disinfection was effected by dry heat, and
eight had arranged with a contractor.</p>

<p>When it is a fact that a few infected rags could let loose
disease of the worst type upon a community, the advantages
to the public of the general practice of disinfection were
incalculable. And in London the advantages were specially
great.</p>

<p>In almost every district hundreds of houses were disinfected
every year, and thousands—even tens of thousands—of
articles.</p>

<p>The system of the compulsory notification of infectious
diseases facilitated greatly the work of disinfection, for by
informing the authorities where cases of such disease
occurred it enabled them to scotch disease in its breeding-places,
and so it was of the greatest benefit to the community.

<p class="p1">Great work was being done in the prevention of the
spread of infectious disease in London by the Metropolitan
Asylums Board, in whose hospitals thousands of persons
suffering from such disease were isolated.</p>

<p>Dr. G. Buchanan, Chief Medical Officer to the Local
Government Board, wrote in <span class="no-break">1892:—</span></p>

<p>“In regard to some infectious cases, notably those of
scarlet fever and diphtheria, there are no means at all to
be compared to isolation in hospital for preventing the
spread of a limited number of cases into a formidable
epidemic.</p>

<p>“And the wonderful and repeated checks to small outbreaks
of smallpox in the metropolis in the course of the
past seven years bears overwhelming evidence to the truth
of this dictum.”</p>

<p>As the population of the metropolis increased in density
it became more and more necessary in the interests of the
people as a whole to make proper and sufficient provision
for the prompt isolation of those of its inhabitants who
might be smitten with infectious disorders.</p>

<p>Home isolation in London was difficult even under the
best circumstances, but in the smaller tenements it was
impossible.</p>

<p>“The removal to hospital of so many of the cases (of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
scarlet fever) is a vast blessing to this neighbourhood,”
wrote the Medical Officer for St. Mary, Newington, in
1897.</p>

<p>For some time a growing tendency on the part of the
public to accept hospital treatment for infectious cases had
been evinced.</p>

<p>“The ‘depauperisation’ of the Hospitals had led to a
great increase in the admissions, so that the public are on
the whole very willing to take advantage of the facilities
offered for having their infectious sick cared for in hospital,
whereby the other members of the patient’s family can
follow their avocations without hindrance and without risk
to the public generally.”</p>

<p>The Chief Sanitary Inspector for Bethnal Green gives
information as to the numbers who from his parish availed
themselves of the hospitals.</p>

<p>“A satisfactory feature, and of the greatest assistance in
dealing with infectious disease, is the large number of
patients now sent to hospital. This year nearly two-thirds
of the cases notified were removed. The importance of this
either to the patients themselves or to the public can hardly
be overestimated.”</p>

<p>By the Public Health London Act, 1891, every inhabitant
of London suffering from any dangerous infectious disease
was entitled to free treatment at one of these hospitals.<a id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
On receipt of notice an ambulance was at once sent for his
removal.</p>

<p>Year by year greater use was made of the Board’s
hospitals, and at times there was not sufficient room in
the Metropolitan Asylums hospitals to receive all the cases.
In 1892 the total number of patients received amounted to
over 13,000, there being at one time 4,389 patients suffering
from all classes of fever or diphtheria receiving treatment in
the hospitals, whilst in 1893 the admissions amounted to
20,316.</p>

<p>By 1895 the Board had eight fever hospitals, including
diphtheria, with 3,384 beds; three ships for smallpox cases
with 300 beds; and a large hospital for convalescents with
1,200 beds. By 1898 the accommodation had reached the
large total of about 6,000.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>
<p>The Chairman of the Metropolitan Asylums Board,
reviewing in 1897 the thirty years’ work of the Board,
<span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“Whilst, during the first twenty years of the Board’s
experience, London was again and again visited with
epidemics of smallpox, during the past seven years it
has, thanks to the action of the managers in having
removed to and isolated at Long Reach all cases of the
disease, been practically non-existent as a health disturbing
factor.</p>

<p>“The percentage mortality of smallpox cases treated by
the Board decreased from 20·81 in 1871 to 4·0 in 1896, and
the annual mortality from 2·42 to practically zero.”</p>

<p>The rate of death from diphtheria also showed a continuous
fall, and this fall had been coincident with the introduction
and increasing use of the anti-toxic serum treatment of the
disease.</p>

<p>A valuable criticism on the existing machinery for the
sanitary government of London was given in a report of
the Metropolitan Asylums Board Statistical Committee in
June, <span class="no-break">1892:—</span></p>

<p>“Although London possesses an ambulance service and
a system of hospitals admittedly unrivalled, yet it has no
central authority charged with the duties of tracing out an
outbreak of this infectious disease (smallpox), and of taking
concerted action towards stamping it out by measures of
disinfection and vaccination and re-vaccination.</p>

<p>“These matters still remain in the hands partly of the 41
local sanitary authorities, partly of the Local Government
Board, and partly of the London County Council.</p>

<p>“Clearly the present arrangements are not only cumbrous
and incapable of that rapid action essential to success in
dealing with infectious disease, but they are also excessively
expensive.”</p>

<p>In connection with hospital accommodation there were
two other factors in the sanitary evolution of London. One
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
of these was the provision made by the Poor Law for the
treatment and care of the sick poor.<a id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Previous to 1867 the accommodation provided by the Poor
Law for the sick was in the sick wards of the workhouses.
The Act of that year, which had established the Metropolitan
Asylums Board, laid the basis for the removal to separate
hospitals of paupers suffering from the worst forms of
infectious disease. The same Act authorised the building
and establishment of Poor Law infirmaries, thus removing
most of the sick from the workhouse wards, giving them
better treatment and better prospect of recovery.</p>

<p>In 1892 the number of new infirmaries was 24, containing
12,445 beds; but a large proportion of the sick were still
kept in the workhouses, the returns for 1890 showing about
4,000 occupied beds in them.</p>

<p>And, in addition to these institutions, there were Poor
Law dispensaries. The establishment of these dated from
1870, and by 1890 there were 44 of them. The immense
amount of work they did is shown by the following figures:
“In 1890 nearly 120,000 orders were given to Medical
Officers for attendance on patients, 53,572 being seen at
their own homes, and 59,149 at the dispensaries. It is
calculated that there are about eight attendances on each
order. Favourable opinions were expressed as to the quality
of the treatment afforded at them.”</p>

<p>There is no means of even forming an estimate of the
results of these great remedial agencies, but that they were
an immense advance on previous arrangements for the
treatment of the sick poor is a well-established fact.</p>

<p>The Lords Select Committee reported <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>“The evidence on the whole appears to indicate a general
recognition of the high standard of efficiency attained by the
best of the new infirmaries.</p>

<p>“The poor do not generally regard the infirmary as they
do the workhouse; they look upon it rather as a State-supported
hospital; they come to the infirmary, are cared
for, cured, and go out again without feeling that they are
tainted with pauperism.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>The other great factor in the sanitary evolution of
London was the group of great hospitals—general and
special—supported, not by the State nor by aid from the
local rates, but by the charitable public, and governed and
managed and worked not by officials, paid either by the
central or local authorities, but by men—lay and medical—who,
from the highest and most public-spirited motives,
devoted themselves to this responsible work.</p>

<p>The general hospitals in 1890 numbered nineteen—some
of them great institutions, such as St. Bartholomew’s, St.
Thomas’s, Guy’s, the London Hospital; and the number of
special hospitals—many of them small—was stated to be
67 in 1890.</p>

<p>“The total number of beds in the general and special
hospitals in London combined was stated by Dr. Steele to
be 8,500, of which 6,500 are continually employed. But
according to Mr. Burdett—8,094 and 6,143.”</p>

<p>“The vast numbers of persons who are treated in out-patients’
departments of hospitals, the number treated at
the eleven hospitals with schools, were estimated by one
witness at over half a million.”</p>

<p>Here, again, no precise estimate can be formed of the part
these great institutions have taken in the sanitary evolution
of London. That their part has been a really great one is
evident without figures—proved not only by the millions
restored to health and capable citizenship, but even more
by their adopting and reducing to practice, and placing
within the reach of the whole community, the vast benefits
following the great scientific discoveries of recent times.</p>

<p>Among the many causes of insanitation, and all its miserable
accompaniments, one of the most hopeless and most
difficult to deal with has always been intemperance or
“drink.” Statistics give no means of estimating its disastrous
consequences, but these consequences always have
been, and still are, of the most deplorable kind. The
overcrowded dwellings and bad sanitary arrangements constantly
tended to increase the habit of intemperance, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the moral degradation caused by drink made people indifferent
to their housing, and lead to the poverty which
increased overcrowding and insanitation.</p>

<p>In London the facilities for obtaining drink are practically
unlimited. In the evidence given before the Royal Commission
on Liquor Licensing Laws, which was appointed in
1896, it was stated <span class="no-break">that:—</span></p>

<p>“In Soho District, in an area of a quarter of a square mile,
there were 1950 inhabited houses and 116 public-houses.
In another district, a little over half a square mile in extent,
there were 259 public-houses (excluding restaurants and
private hotels).”</p>

<p>Down one mile of Whitechapel Road there were 45 public-houses.</p>

<p>“The streets branching off, the hinterland, are also
thickly supplied; some exactly opposite each other.”</p>

<p>“In one street in St. George-in-the-East so crowded are
the public-houses that there are 27 licensed houses out of
215 houses.”</p>

<p>And these facilities are intensified by the great number of
hours during the day in which licensed houses keep their
doors open to all comers.</p>

<p>Parliament has done but little to mitigate this terrible
evil. Happily, however, other influences are at work.</p>

<p>The Royal Commissioners in their Report in 1899 <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p>“Most persons who have studied the question are of
opinion that actual drunkenness has materially diminished
in all classes of society in the last twenty-five or thirty years.
Many causes have contributed to this. The zealous labour
of countless workers in the temperance cause counts for
much. Education has opened avenues to innumerable
studies which interest the rising generation. The taste for
reading has multiplied manyfold within a comparatively
brief period. The passion for games and athletics, which
has been so remarkably stimulated during the past quarter
of a century, has served as a powerful rival to ‘boozing,’
which was at one time almost the only excitement open to
working men.” And then followed this weighty statement:
“Yet it is undeniable that a gigantic evil remains to be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
remedied, and hardly any sacrifice would be too great
which would result in a marked diminution of this national
degradation.”</p>

<p>And the Chairman of the Commission (Viscount Peel),
the Archbishop of Canterbury, and seven Commissioners in
a Minority Report stated <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“The broad facts remain unchallenged of the prevalence
of the evil arising from drink.”</p>

<p>That drink and insanitary housing constitute a vicious
circle should by no means deter the most vigorous efforts
being continued to improve the conditions of housing and
to raise the standard of the public health.</p>

<p>There was widespread testimony through the latter half
of the decade that the public health in London was improving.
Thus the Medical Officer of Health for the Bow
District in Poplar wrote in 1895: “We have only to
remember what London used to be, and consolation can be
found in the comparison. Epidemics are not so frequent,
disease is not so virulent, and those attacked stand greater
chances of recovery through better and more skilful
treatment.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Paddington in
1896: “There has been a steady diminution in water-borne
disease since efficiently-filtered Thames water has
been substituted for the numerous wells and pumps of
former days.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for the Strand reported
in 1897: “The Strand District (as to health) compares
favourably with other years. The result of your labours is
a steady improvement in the health of the inhabitants.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for Islington in 1897
reported the death-rate as 15·80—the lowest since registration
was introduced in 1837.</p>

<p>In Whitechapel “the policy of your Board has resulted in
a considerable saving of human life.” The death-rate for
the district in 1879 was 26·0 per 1,000, and in 1899 it was
19·3 per 1,000.</p>

<p>In Battersea the death-rate was 26·8 in 1871, and 17·6 in
1901.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>But infantile mortality did not show a similar rate of
improvement. In many parishes there was a decided improvement.
In many, however, infantile mortality remained
at a very high rate.</p>

<p>In Bethnal Green, in 1893, nearly half the total deaths
were of children under five years of age—a figure which
drew from the Medical Officer of Health the remark:
“The ignorance of women of the working classes on the
subject of infant feeding is colossal.” In 1896 it was 51·5
per cent., and in 1898 it was 49·7 per cent.</p>

<p>In Poplar the Medical Officer of Health wrote, in 1895:
“I think it my duty to point out the terribly high rate of infant mortality….”<br /><br /></p>

<p class="p1">“It is an awful state of affairs that so many young
children die every year.”</p>

<p>In Shoreditch, in 1896, 49·1 per cent. of the total deaths
were of children under five; in Islington, in 1896, 42·4 per
cent.; in Hackney, in 1898, 40·9 per cent.; in Fulham, in
1896, 51 per cent.</p>

<p>On the south side of the river—in St. George-the-Martyr,
in 1894, it was 58 per cent. of the total deaths; in St. Olave,
Southwark, 48·6 per cent. in 1896.</p>

<p>A most hopeful sign was the greater public interest taken
in matters pertaining to the public health.</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for Islington wrote in
<span class="no-break">1892:—</span></p>

<p>“With the advance of education the public and Parliament
appreciate the importance of more and more safeguarding
the public health.”</p>

<p>In <span class="no-break">1895:—</span></p>

<p>“They (middle class) will not tolerate the sanitation of
a few years ago; indeed, they expect that the houses they
live in will at least be rendered safe against the entrance of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
sewer gas, and themselves safeguarded against infectious
disease.”</p>

<p>And the Medical Officer of Health for the “City” in
<span class="no-break">1894:—</span></p>

<p>“Attention has been more particularly directed to
premises and dwellings of the better class, the occupants
of which are becoming more and more exacting owing to the
increased knowledge acquired by the public on all sanitary
questions. Some of these premises are of great size and
employ many hundreds of persons, and many enormous
insurance, banking, and gigantic commercial establishments.”</p>

<p>And that there is a community of interest in a healthy
London was becoming more widely realised. That the fact
should have taken so long to be grasped is extraordinary as
it was so manifest a one. Over and over again it had been
proved that disease was not restrained by the paper boundaries
of parishes, and that once set alight anywhere no
limit could be put to its widespread devastations. An unhealthy
area in any part of the metropolis constituted a
danger to the whole. Nor was disease a respecter of classes.
All were interested in keeping it away.</p>

<p>And, after many painful lessons, people were realising
much more than formerly that disease was a most costly
infliction. The Medical Officer of Health for St. James’,
Westminster, in his report for 1893, set out the business
aspect of <span class="no-break">it:—</span></p>

<p>“The position of St. James’, as the shopping centre for
the best retail trade of the West-end of London, makes the
district more and more a city of luxurious shops, hotels,
clubs, and lodging-houses. Increasing facilities for travel
to the suburbs, and the increasing value of premises, necessitate
its utilisation for business purposes during the day,
and its comparative desertion at night…. Its resident
population of 25,000 persons is therefore an inadequate
exponent of the activity of its daily life, of the importance of
its retail trade, and of the necessity for active sanitation.
An outbreak of smallpox or of cholera would at once so
damage the trade of the district as to inflict upon its
ratepayers a thousand times the cost which is now incurred
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
by their preventive sanitary service, and by the prompt
removal of infectious cases to suburban hospitals as is now
done.”</p>

<p>But that was only a single and a limited case.</p>

<p>The industrial classes realised to a greater extent than
ever before the disastrous results to themselves and their
families of sickness and ill-health; the prolonged suffering,
the loss of work and wages, the ensuing hardships. And it
was upon them more than on others that the effects of
disease fell most heavily.</p>

<p>In most matters the interests of the various parts of
London, and of the various classes, are one and the same,
but in none to anything like the same extent as in the vital
matter of public health. Here they are one and indivisible.</p>

<p>But neither Parliament nor the Government had got so
far as to recognise that yet, and London—the great metropolis—with
its four-and-a-half millions of people, was left
for its protection against disease to a number of semi-independent
local sanitary authorities who had no authority
beyond their own area, and who could take no action for the
safety of London as a whole.</p>

<p>One thing was absolutely certain—and that was that the
civic life of London had within the decade been lifted to
altogether a higher plane. The publicity of the proceedings
of the central representative authority—whether of its
meetings in the Council Chamber, or of its constant applications
to Parliament for legislation embodying far-reaching
civic reforms in London—the triennial elections, when the
area of discussion was shifted from the Council Chamber to
the constituencies, quickened the interest and awoke the
dormant masses of the people to the importance of civic
administration and of civic laws.</p>

<p>In this remarkable change the subject of the public health
strode to the front. Men began to realise how it entered
into every branch or part of their own lives and of their
families, how its ramifications invaded every part of their
existence, how much their welfare and comfort and even
their existence depended upon it. And the people had a
great load lifted off them—the load of despair begotten by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
the hopelessness of any amelioration of the conditions of
life which so long had weighed them down. They felt now
that there was some one to whom they could complain,
some public authority who would see that things would be
righted, if they could be righted, and hope was born in
their lives.</p>

<p>In 1899 another change was made in the system of local
government in London.</p>

<p>The Act of 1888, while dealing with the central government
of London, had practically not touched the local
areas. The work was felt to be incomplete, and in 1893
Commissioners were appointed “to consider the proper
conditions under which the amalgamation of the City and
the County of London can be effected, and to make specific
and practical proposals for that purpose.”</p>

<p>They reported in August, 1894. Their general conclusion
was contained in the following paragraph.<a id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>“A consideration of the evidence we have received confirms
the opinion suggested by the course of previous
inquiries and of legislation, or, in other words, by the historic
development of the metropolis, that the government of
London must be entrusted to one body, exercising certain
functions throughout all the areas covered by the name, and
to a number of local bodies exercising certain other functions
within the local areas which collectively make up London,
the central body and the local bodies deriving their authority
as representative bodies by direct election, and the functions
assigned to each being determined so as to secure complete
independence and responsibility to every member of the
system.”</p>

<p>In February, 1899, Mr. Balfour introduced in the House
of Commons a “London Government Bill.”<a id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> He referred
to the Act of 1888 which created the London County
Council as effecting a change “so much in consonance with
the traditions of English municipal government that it is
likely to be permanent,” and <span class="no-break">said:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>“We recognise to the full that there must be a great
central authority in London.”</p>

<p>“Broadly speaking,” he said, “the administrative Vestry
and the District Board exist now as they were framed in
1855.”</p>

<p>“It is with these administrative Vestries and District
Boards that the present Bill proposes to deal. It is with
the subordinate area, not with the central area, that we are
now concerned.</p>

<p>“We do not propose to touch the City of London.</p>

<p>“We have determined that, by the appointed day it would
be desirable that all London should be divided into areas
for local government, and that every area should be simultaneously
provided with all the necessary machinery for
government of its local affairs.”</p>

<p>He mentioned the areas.</p>

<p>“The constitution of the governing bodies in these areas
shall be practically identical with the constitution which
our great municipal boroughs already possess….</p>

<p>“We propose that there should be mayor, councillors, and
aldermen.</p>

<p>“As regards their powers—the Vestries already possess
(except as to police) the great urban powers possessed by
other municipalities. Certain powers agreed upon between
the Vestries and the London County Council at certain
recent conferences will be added, and there would be transferred
to them the powers relating to baths and wash-houses,
libraries, and burial boards.”</p>

<p>“On an appointed day every elective Vestry and District
Board in the County of London is to cease to exist. He
hoped the plan would come into operation in November,
1900.”</p>

<p>The Bill became an Act—“The London Government
Act”—in 1899.</p>

<p>The new municipal boroughs numbered twenty-nine—“the
City of London” and twenty-eight others; sixteen
of them consisting of single parishes, and the remaining
twelve of several amalgamated parishes.</p>

<p>A few extra duties were cast upon them. Among them
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
the duty of enforcing within their borough the bye-laws and
regulations with respect to dairies and milk, slaughter-houses,
and offensive businesses; and in some respects their powers
were enlarged, the principal addition being the power to
adopt and use the provisions of Part III. of the Housing of
the Working Classes Act, 1890, within their borough.</p>

<p>All preparations for the change were completed by the
autumn of 1899; the new Municipal Councils were elected
on the 4th of November, the forty-three Vestries and District
Boards ceased to exist, and London entered upon a new
stage of her career.</p>

<p>Here, at the close of 1900, the Vestries and the District
Boards of London came to their decreed end, and disappeared
from the scene of London civic life. That end
was not regretted by the general public, whose opinion
may be gauged from the fact that the name “Vestry”
had become almost synonymous with incapacity, mismanagement,
neglect, sometimes even of graver transgressions,
though in later years the Vestries did something
towards removing from themselves that reproach.</p>

<p>They certainly had done much useful work, and even at
the outset of their existence were a great improvement
upon their predecessors. They had found their parishes
and districts forty-five years previously in the state described
in the first and second chapters of this work—a
chaos of filth, a slough of insanitation and deadly
disease, and the great mass of the people living in misery
indescribable—and the task before them was one which
might have daunted the stoutest heart.</p>

<p>In many ways they did their work well; local sewerage
and house drainage were effectually carried out; the refuse
of the great city was regularly removed; the paving, and
lighting, and cleansing of the streets were greatly improved.</p>

<p>But in many parts of London, and by many Vestries and
District Boards, the larger, graver problems with which
they were confronted were scarcely dealt with at all.
Powers entrusted to them by Parliament were not used,
vitally important duties imposed upon them by Parliament
were ignored or neglected. Had this been pure
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
incapacity it would have been deplorable, but upon many
of the Vestries were men who either were themselves
interested in continuing existing evils and abuses, or whose
friends were, and so laws which should have removed or
mitigated the evils were not administered.</p>

<p>And the result was the non-prevention of diseases which
led to deaths, and the continuance of miseries (consequent
on disease) which might have been warded off, and the
sowing of the seeds of evils of which we are still reaping
the crop.</p>

<p>As years went by the pressure of public opinion upon
them became more insistent, and their administration improved,
but even to the end many of them grievously failed
to fulfil the responsibilities of their position.</p>

<p>One class of workers under them must, however, be
excluded from such blame, namely, the Medical Officers
of Health.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that the greater part of the
sanitary progress which was made all through the period
of Vestry rule was directly due to the unceasing labour, the
courageous efforts, the insistence of many of these officers.
Their recommendations were often ignored, their requests
constantly denied, their opinions made light of; but in spite
of such discouragement they persevered. And not alone did
they bravely stand between disease and the people, but they
were ever striving to drive it back, and to destroy its prolific
sources and its power; ever urging upon their employers the
necessity for action to relieve the people from the worst of
the evils they were suffering under.</p>

<p>The description given in 1856 by one of them that their
work was “a war of the community against individuals
for the public good” had been proved to be absolutely
true.</p>

<p>And in that war, of them generally, it is to be said that
there were no sturdier fighters on the side of the community
than they proved to be.</p>

<p>In 1885 Dr. J. Liddle, “a pioneer of reform,” died after
thirty years of “unflinching adherence to duty” as Medical
Officer of Health for Whitechapel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1889 Dr. N. Vinen died after thirty-four years’ service
as Medical Officer of Health for St. Olave, Southwark.<a id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>In 1895 Dr. J. S. Bristowe passed away after forty years
of service as Medical Officer of Health for Camberwell.</p>

<p>And there are still in the service men whose labours have
extended over prolonged periods. Such men as these, and
others of them who gave their best to the service of the
community, have indeed a claim to the lasting gratitude of
the citizens of London.</p>

<h2 class="chaptHead"><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center">1901–1906</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Once</span> more the census placed on record the actual population
of the great metropolis, no longer divided, so far as
local government was concerned, into parishes and districts,
but now into a smaller number of municipal boroughs. The
figures of this census are the last available for reliable
deductions as to numerous important matters forming part
of that comprehensive subject, the sanitary evolution of
London.</p>

<p>The enumerated population of London had reached the
great number of 4,536,541, and showed an increase of
308,224 during the ten years 1891 to 1901. The rate of
increase, however, continued to show a decline, having
fallen from 10·4 to 7·3 per cent. during the intercensal
period.</p>

<p>The same movement of the population noted in previous
censuses was recorded in this one.</p>

<p>In the City of London and six of the central metropolitan
boroughs the enumerated population showed an actual
decline of over 67,000 in the ten years, notwithstanding
that the recorded excess of births over deaths in that period
amounted approximately to 70,000.</p>

<p>In all the other boroughs there had been increases. In
the Eastern group the increases had been very small, with
the exception of Stepney, where, owing to the immigration
of aliens, the population had increased 13,484. In the
Northern group the greatest increase had been in Hackney
(19,666). In the Western group Fulham showed the highest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
increase, namely, 45,500; whilst on the south side of the
river, Wandsworth had increased 76,500, and several others
showed large increases.</p>

<p>Outside the boundaries of the county the “outer ring”
had attained to a population of 2,044,553 persons—an
increase of 639,000.</p>

<p>If the metropolis and this “outer ring” were regarded as
one city—and in many matters it is hard to consider them
apart—the total population in 1901 was 6,581,372.</p>

<p>The information as to the birthplaces of the people
showed that of the 4,536,541 persons, 3,016,580 were
natives of London. The proportion of natives of London
had increased; the proportion from the rest of the United
Kingdom had decreased; whilst there had been an increase
of 40,000 foreigners, the number having considerably more
than doubled since 1881. Of every 1,000 inhabitants, 668
were born in London, and 332 elsewhere, as against 653
and 347 respectively in 1891.</p>

<p>Once again the arrivals and departures by the gates of
life and death were recorded. In the ten years from the
1st of April, 1891, to the 31st of March, 1901, 1,329,428
births had been registered, and 838,454 deaths. The excess
of births over deaths, therefore, was 490,974; and as the
increase of population was 309,228, it followed that 181,746
persons had migrated. As the migration had only been
114,000 in 1891, it was manifest that migration to outside
the County of London was increasing.</p>

<p>The total number of inhabited houses was 571,768, as
against 547,146 in 1891; but owing to a variation in the
manner of collecting the information, the figures have little
value for comparative purposes.</p>

<p>The accurate figures given of the population of London
enabled the death-rate to be calculated on facts instead of
upon estimates.</p>

<p>The death-rate was 17·1 per 1,000 living in 1901, a
decrease from 18·6 in the previous year, and from 21·0
in 1891.</p>

<p>But to be set against this was the portentous fact that
the birth-rate had declined from 31·8 per 1,000 in 1891 to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
29·0 per 1,000 persons living in 1901, the lowest recorded in
London since civil registration began.</p>

<p>The public health of London was now altogether on a
better level than it had been before, but in the course of
the year 1901 some cases of smallpox appeared in various
parts of London, and in 1902 there was the most severe
outbreak of it—with the possible exception of 1884–5—since
1871, nearly 9,000 cases being admitted to the hospitals of
the Metropolitan Asylums Board between September, 1901,
and July, 1902. Ninety-three patients were removed to
hospital in one day, and on one day (March 11th) 1,604
cases were under treatment. Over 1,300 persons died of it
in the year.</p>

<p>The cost of disease to the community has often been
referred to in previous chapters. The Metropolitan Asylums
Board stated that so far as it was concerned, the cost for
1901–2 might be put at £500,000—equal to about a threepenny
rate—a sum which was wholly apart from loss of
wages to the individual, and various other expenses, and
apart from the charge upon the rates of those who were
pauperised by the death of the breadwinner of the family.</p>

<p>1903 was “a year of comparatively very slight prevalence
of infectious disorders.”</p>

<p>In 1904 there was “a marked absence of undue activity
amongst the infectious diseases of the metropolis.”</p>

<p>And 1905 was the healthiest year in the records of
London since registration, the death-rate being 15·1 per
1,000.</p>

<p>In the five years which have passed since the census of
1901, Parliament has passed three Acts of the utmost consequence
to the sanitary condition of the people of London,
marking, in their respective spheres, definite stages in the
sanitary evolution of the metropolis.</p>

<p>The sanitary evils to which many of the people were
subject might, as has already been stated, be roughly divided
into two classes—those of their dwellings at night, and those
of their workplaces in the day.</p>

<p>“The Factory and Workshop Act” of 1901 dealt with
the latter. It was the amendment and final codification of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
a mass of piecemeal legislation which had been spread over
a period of years.</p>

<p>In 1878, previous enactments on the subject had been
consolidated into one Act. That Act was amended in 1883,
1891, and 1895. All were now finally embodied in this Act
of 1901 with several additions and amendments. Additional
sanitary provisions were made as to the ventilation of
factories and workshops, and as to the drainage of floors.
Bakehouses came within the scope of the Act, and the law
was made much more stringent as to them. After January
1, 1904, it would be unlawful to use any underground bakehouse
unless certified by the Borough Council to be suitable.</p>

<p>A register of workshops was to be kept, and the Medical
Officer of Health was, in his annual report, to report
specifically on the administration of the Act in workshops
and workplaces—a direction which ensured publicity as to the
action of the local authorities. The powers of the sanitary
authorities were extended by the Act, and certain duties
necessary for efficient administration imposed upon them.</p>

<p>The Act also ensured the inspection of dwelling-houses
where there were outworkers.</p>

<p>The work imposed on the Sanitary Authorities was very
considerable as a very large number of premises came under
their supervision, and every workroom in each workshop
had to be measured in order that its cubic space might be
ascertained; and when the subsequent routine inspection of
the premises, and of outworkers’ premises, remedying of
defects and other duties, were taken into consideration, the
magnitude of the work, and the necessity of an adequate
staff of officers, were evident.</p>

<p>The records show that at the end of 1904, 34,488 workshops
in London were under the supervision of the local
authorities. The necessity of inspection was demonstrated
by the fact that 18,922 conditions required remedying.</p>

<p>Improvement was testified to by the Medical Officers of
Health, overcrowding was diminished, and it was further
stated that “employers are found to co-operate willingly with
the local authorities in the remedy of faulty conditions.”</p>

<p>Altogether, then, when a comparison is made between the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
conditions of the factories and workshops, and workplaces in
which the people worked in the middle of the last century
and now, the contrast is remarkable. The worst of the
evils have been swept away, and healthy conditions of work
have taken their place.</p>

<p>And the limitations put upon the labour of children and
young persons and women have all been to the good of those
subjected to them. And the public health of London, so far
as this very large and very valuable portion of the population
is concerned, has been immensely the gainer.</p>

<p>The second of the three Acts since 1900, which had a
vital bearing on the sanitary condition of the people of
London, was “The Metropolis Water Act” of 1902.</p>

<p>That the water supply should be under the control and
management of the municipality had long been advocated,
but though hundreds of County and Municipal Authorities
in Great Britain—many of them not the hundredth part of
the size of London—had a Municipal Water Supply, that
great boon was denied to London. The reform was
vigorously pressed by the central representative body of
London—the London County Council—and after several
Royal Commissions of Inquiry, Parliament dealt with the
subject in 1902. But the manner of dealing with it was
unfortunate and retrograde.</p>

<p>A new public Board—the Metropolitan Water Board—was
established for the purpose of acquiring, by purchase,
for the inhabitants of London, and of certain areas outside
London, the undertakings of the eight Metropolitan Water
Companies, and for managing and carrying on the supply
of water. The great bulk of the purchase money was to
be provided by the ratepayers of London, and the great
bulk of the debt to be a charge on the rateable property
of London.</p>

<p>The Board was to consist of 66 members, 14 of whom
were to be nominated by the London County Council, 31
by the Metropolitan Borough Councils and the City Corporation,
and the remaining 21 by the authorities of localities
outside London hitherto supplied by the Companies.</p>

<p>The Board, therefore, was not a representative body
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
directly elected by the ratepayers or electors of London,
but was constructed, on the discredited precedent of the
Metropolitan Board of Works, of delegated instead of elected
members; and though the people of London were emancipated
from the control of trading Water Companies, they
got in their place a body over which they can exercise no
direct, and therefore very little actual, control.</p>

<p>The new Board was constituted in the spring of 1903, and
took over the undertakings of the Water Companies on the
24th of June, 1904, at the cost to the ratepayers of London
of not much less than £40,000,000, a sum immensely higher
than that at which they could have been acquired many
years before.</p>

<p>And inasmuch as the Board can call upon the ratepayers
of London to make good any deficiency of income resulting
from their management, the unsatisfactory result is the
establishment in London of a new indirectly-elected public
body vested with enormous financial powers affecting the
interests of the ratepayers of London, and yet but little
responsible to public control.</p>

<p>The third of the three important Acts, the Education
London Act, was passed in 1903, and carried in its bosom
possibilities of the most far-reaching benefits to the health
and physical welfare of future generations.</p>

<p>By this Act the London School Board was abolished,
and its duties transferred to the London County Council,
which was constituted the Education Authority for London.</p>

<p>Though, indirectly, the schools of the Board were having
considerable effect upon the physical well-being of the rising
generation, it cannot be said that the School Board had
utilised its vast opportunities for improving the general
health. By instruction, by influence, it might have done so
much, might have moulded the physical future of generations.
But education was always much more in the minds
of the Board than health, though the two might well have
been considered together, and without health education is
of little use.</p>

<p>The Board in their “Final Report” endeavoured to offer
an explanation of their inaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>“It has always been a question how far the Board are
authorised to spend public money on the medical care of
children. On the one hand suggestions have been made for
the inspection of their teeth, and the treatment of cases of
anæmic condition and arrested development. On the other
hand a legal opinion has been expressed that the Board are
not entitled to do anything, or to take any measures except
such as spring from the fact that the attendance of the
children is compulsory. On this account it has been thought
right to take action only in those cases in which on account
of contagious disease, it is necessary to exclude children
from school.”<a id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>Even the sanitary condition of the schools does not
appear to have been well looked after.</p>

<p>In January, 1890, one of the Committees submitted a
report to the Board, on which the resolution was <span class="no-break">passed—</span></p>

<p>“That the Committee be authorised to thoroughly examine
the whole of the drainage of any school of the Board where
they may think it necessary,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>The drainage was subsequently examined. In 181 schools
the drainage was all right. In 292 of the schools re-drainage
was required. For how long that fertile source of disease
had been scattering its evil germs among the tens of
thousands of children attending these insanitary schools, no
information is available.</p>

<p>In 1890, just twenty years after its formation, the Board
appointed a Medical Officer, and he gave only a portion of
his time to the work.</p>

<p>“Before 1891 there was no attempt on the part of the
Board to prevent the spread of infectious diseases by precautionary
measures being adopted in the school.”<a id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>In 1895 the Medical Officer of Health for Paddington
<span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“School teachers should be required to inform the Sanitary
Authority of any special amount of illness which may occur
among the scholars. Half a school may be away through
sickness if the disease be not a notified one, but no information
of such fact comes to the Sanitary Authority.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>And in 1896 he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The past year had emphasised the need of definite instructions
to school teachers to keep the Medical Officers of
Health informed of the existence of infectious disease among
their pupils. It is surmised that there were upwards of
2,000 cases of measles in the parish in the earlier part of the
year.”</p>

<p>And “measles is the most fatal disease of childhood.”</p>

<p>In evening schools “efforts were made between 1899 and
1903 to teach the simple laws of health…. Prior to 1898
gymnastics were taught in only a few schools.”<a id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>In 1902 the Medical Officer resigned, and a new one was
appointed who should give his whole time to the work. His
first report (1903) is enlightening as to the methods of the
School Board in matters pertaining to the health of the
children attending the schools.</p>

<p>He <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The maintenance of sanitary conditions as regards heating,
lighting, ventilation, and cleanliness both of the
buildings and persons of the pupils, the detection of early
cases of illness … ill-health from many causes, school
habits, and school work in their influence on health …
these … come under the daily work of the teacher, and
there is no requirement that any knowledge of such matters
should be possessed by him. It is left to his own common-sense,
and he muddles through. The definite requirement
of hygienic knowledge as part of the equipment of every
teacher is a necessity if a great part of the work of this
department is not to be useless in result.”<a id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>And in his Report of the following year he <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>“The provision of medical oversight for school life is
rapidly becoming a necessity. Five-sixths of the population
spend a seventh part of their lives under the exceedingly
artificial conditions of the schools, and during the plastic
period of life. Their chief function in the earlier part of that
period is to grow, and it is necessary that they should not
only do this, but do it under favourable circumstances for
development.”<a id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Soon after the transfer of the administration of the
Education Acts to the London County Council, the medical
work of the late School Board was amalgamated with that of
the London County Council. The change is one which is likely
to be of the greatest benefit to the children in the schools,
and through them, as times go on, to the population of
London as a whole. The great value of health will
receive greater recognition than it has done hitherto, whilst
greater facilities for instruction in health matters, and
better physical training, cannot fail to have the most beneficial
effect. The vast field for this work is evident when
it is called to mind that nearly half a million of children
are in average attendance at the London County Council
Schools.</p>

<p>Three other matters legislated upon by Parliament claim
mention.</p>

<p>In 1902 the Midwives Act was passed. It provided for
the constitution of a Central Midwives Board with power to
frame rules for the registration of midwives and for regulating
and supervising the practice of midwives. After the 1st
of April, 1905, no person might use the title of midwife without
being certified under the Act. The London County
Council was constituted the local supervising authority for
London, and under its supervision much good has already
been done.</p>

<p>Also in 1902 the Cremation Act, which empowered burial
authorities to provide and maintain crematoria, and empowered
the Secretary of State to make regulations as
to the conditions under which cremation might take
place.</p>

<p>And to complete the tale of sanitary legislation since 1900,
a few reforms were secured by sections in the annual General
Powers Acts which the London County Council obtained
from Parliament. Among these was one rather important
one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1894 the duty of supervising and regulating the common
lodging-houses in London, which hitherto had been
performed by the Commissioner of Police, was transferred
to the London County Council. In that year 654 such
houses were on the register, and the authorised number of
lodgers was close upon 30,000 persons. In 1902 the Council
obtained powers for the annual licensing of such houses.
These larger powers enabled the Council to improve the
sanitary condition of many of these houses. The supervision
of these houses has been most satisfactorily carried
out, and has been of immense value in securing sanitary
abodes for the miserable people who frequent them, and in
diminishing what would otherwise doubtless often be a source
of infection to the community.</p>

<p>The sanitary evolution of London having begun a little
before the middle of the nineteenth century, the figures
of the censuses of 1851 and 1901 afford the means for
measuring many of the great changes which have taken
place in the intervening period.</p>

<p>And a comparison of the state of those things which
most affect the public health at these two dates enables a
reliable deduction to be drawn as to whether there has been
evolution to a higher level of public health, or a retrogression;
and, if the former, the progress which that
evolution has made.</p>

<p>In 1851 the population of London was 2,362,236. In
1901 it had reached 4,536,541. And when to this is added
the fact that all through the intervening years so enormous
a mass of people has been cooped up in an area of 117 square
miles, and that at the present time there are over 4,500,000
within that small area, the multiplicity of the matters
decisively influencing their health and physical well being,
and the vastness of the issues at stake, come into vivid
light.</p>

<p>As has been often said, the very basis or foundation of
the sanitation of a city is an efficient system of drainage.
Without it sanitation is impossible.</p>

<p>What the main drainage of London was up to 1858 has
been described in the earlier chapters of this book. In effect,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
nothing less than an entire system had then to be designed
and constructed to provide London with this first essential.
This was done, and the result was of immediate and
enormous benefit to London, and ever since then the
maintenance and extension and improvement of this work
has received the solicitous attention of the Central Authority.
Originally designed for 3,500,000 people, it had, as London
grew, to be considerably enlarged and extended, and as some
of the districts outside the boundaries of London were
allowed by Parliament to drain into the London sewers, still
larger works had to be constructed. And now the system
serves a resident population of, in round figures, 5,500,000
people spread over an area of about 140 square miles. It
comprises close upon 90 miles of great intercepting and outfall
sewers, 176 miles of main sewers, and 26 miles of large
relief sewers, constructed for the special purpose of conveying
storm-water away.</p>

<p>This, however, was but part of the provision which had to
be made. During the <i>régime</i> of the Metropolitan Board of
Works, more than 1,100 miles of new sewers were laid by
Vestries and District Boards in their respective districts, and
since the creation of the London County Council of 1888,
further additions of 1,516 miles have been made, making a
total of over 2,600 miles.</p>

<p>All this work was essential to enable a proper system
of house drainage to be carried out, and as the drainage of
houses into the local sewers was compulsory, the general
system of drainage was thus rounded off or completed.</p>

<p>The change effected thereby in the conditions of life in
London has been remarkable. There are no longer open
ditch-sewers polluting the air with their pestilential abominations;
no longer streets without sewers, and houses without
the possibility of drainage.</p>

<p>In the Report of the County Council for 1902–3, prepared
by the Clerk of the Council, there is given a calculation of
what these works annually accomplish.</p>

<p>“The flow of sewage during the year, namely 87,556
million gallons, represents a canal 24 feet wide with a depth
of 9 feet, running day and night at the rate of 2 feet per
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
second; or it may be considered as equivalent to a lake of
44 square miles, or about one-third of the area of the county
of London, with a depth of 11⅕ feet.”</p>

<p>To the efficiency and thoroughness of the present system
is primarily due the greatly improved condition of the public
health of London as compared with 1855.</p>

<p>Water was another of the absolute necessities of existence
and of sanitation. An ample supply of good water is
essential for health; and the numerous outbreaks of
typhoid fever which in recent years have occurred in
England with a heavy death-roll, testify to the dangers incurred
by bad water, and the necessity for the utmost care
being taken to secure its being pure and uncontaminated.</p>

<p>The supply of water in the eighteen-fifties had been
very limited in quantity, and, with the exception of that
supplied by one company, abominable in quality. And
progress to a better state of things was slow. Improvements
were made most unwillingly and haltingly by the
Water Companies, and only under Parliament’s reluctant
compulsion, whilst the inaction of most, and the obstruction
of some, of the Vestries and District Boards, and the
hostility of “owners” of houses to being put to expense
for water fittings, still further impeded reform, and
perpetuated the evils inflicted upon the inhabitants of
London—suffering, disease, and death.</p>

<p>The “slaughter wells” and the sewer-ditches were,
however, filled up and those evil sources of supply ended.
And a supply of water was gradually extended to the
streets which were without any, and an increased supply
to others which had but little; but it was not until 1899,
the very end of the century, that the County of London
was, for the first time, receiving a constant supply in
accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Water
Act of 1871. And by slow degrees the sources of defilement
of the water were reduced, and a larger proportion
of the dirt ingredients filtered out, until at last some of
the worst evils connected with the supply were rectified.
And in 1891 it was enacted by Parliament<a id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> that a dwelling-house
without a proper and sufficient supply should be
a “nuisance” liable to be dealt with summarily.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>
<p>The main cause of all the grave disadvantages the people
of London had so unceasingly suffered under in this matter
arose from the fact that the interests of the Water
Companies and the interests of the people of London ran
directly counter to each other. London, in fact, had from
the very outset been at the mercy of trading companies
for its supply of this necessity of life, and bitter cause,
indeed, had London to rue it.</p>

<p>It is too soon to know what improvements will result
in the supply of water to the people of London, but in
the interests of the public health it is most unsatisfactory
that the public should even now be debarred from that direct
control which alone can secure them the fullest benefits.</p>

<p>In another of the numerous branches of the great subject
of the public health of London—the widening of the streets
and thoroughfares—the improvements made in process
of years was marked, and the better provision of light and
air and breathing space has been considerable.</p>

<p>The total gross cost of new streets and improvements
carried out by the Metropolitan Board of Works had
amounted to over £12,000,000,<a id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> whilst it had contributed
another million and a half to the cost of smaller street
improvements carried out by the “City” and other districts,
which latter also expended considerable sums.</p>

<p>The London County Council continued the policy of
the Metropolitan Board of Works, and by the year 1904–5
it had carried out, or was in process of carrying out,
improvements at an estimated gross cost of over
£11,000,000,<a id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> the greatest and most costly of all being
the new thoroughfare—Kingsway and Aldwych—connecting
Holborn with the Strand, which swept away some of the
most notorious and worst slums in London.</p>

<p>In addition to these, many local improvements have
been carried out by the “City” and by the Vestries and
District Boards, and later by the Borough Councils. These
were estimated to cost about £1,800,000. The total work
accomplished, therefore, has been very considerable, but
the cost has been huge; amounting in the whole to about
£27,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>Of greater value to the health of the people has been
the increase of the number of parks and open spaces in
London, not merely in preventing land being built over,
but in the opportunities afforded the people, and especially
the younger portion of them, for exercise.</p>

<p>Here considerable acquisitions have been made since the
time of the Metropolitan Board of Works. Immediately
after the creation of the London County Council two
generous gifts were made to the citizens of London—Waterlow
Park of 30 acres and Myatt’s Fields—and the
Council had acquired Hackney Marsh, with 337 acres;
Brockwell Park, with 127 acres; and Avery Hill, 84 acres;
and some distance from London, 803 acres of Hainault
Forest. In addition to these several small pieces of ground
were acquired and thrown open as public gardens and
recreation grounds.</p>

<p>The “City” had also acquired, outside the County of
London, Epping Forest, about 5,560 acres in extent,
Burnham Beeches, 375 acres; Coulsdon Common, 347 acres;
and a few small open spaces in the “City” itself.</p>

<p>And many acquisitions had been made by the Vestries
and District Boards, and, since their supersession, by the
Borough Councils.</p>

<p>Purity of air was another of the important elements
of a satisfactory health condition.</p>

<p>Once that the Thames had ceased to be the main sewer
of London, and once that the hundreds of thousands
of cesspools were filled in and abolished, the most persistent
and fruitful and worst of the causes of the impurity and
unwholesomeness of the atmosphere were removed. Gradually
too, but only too slowly—a slowness resulting in
widespread loss of health and life—were the noxious trades
in London made amenable to the law, and somewhat less
noxious to those living in their immediate neighbourhood;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
this, too, without that ruin to trade and manufactures which
was always predicted when any effort was made to prevent
the prevalence of intolerable nuisances.</p>

<p>The duty of administering the provisions of the law
relating to the abatement of smoke nuisances rested with
the police. Under their action a steady reduction had
taken place in offences against the law. In 1882, 1,248
cases were reported, and there had been 162 convictions;
and in 1890 the numbers had sunk to 702 reported cases
and 46 convictions.</p>

<p>In 1891, by the Public Health London Act, the duty
was transferred to the Sanitary Authorities. Considerable
use has been made by them of the Act. In many cases
severe penalties were imposed, and the general result has
been a very satisfactory improvement. Much, however,
of the fouling of the atmosphere is caused by factories
outside London, and consequently outside the control of
the local authorities of London.</p>

<p>And yet another of the great branches of the general
subject of the public health is the food supply of the people.
It would be difficult to give any approximate estimate even
of the part which good or bad food has in its effect upon
the public health, or to produce any statistics on the
subject, but, undoubtedly, it is a very large part; and
every now and then the outbreak of some serious illness
and heavy loss of life, directly traceable to the consumption
of bad food, shows how important it is to safeguard the
people from such disasters.</p>

<p>Thus in 1901 there was an outbreak of scarlet fever,
in which some 300 persons were attacked, directly traced
to an infective milk supply.</p>

<p>Previous to the date of the Nuisances Removal Act of
1855 there was, so far as London was concerned, practically
no control or supervision over the food sold to and consumed
by the people. That Act contained a section providing
for the inspection of food by the local sanitary authority,
so the importance of securing wholesome food for the
people was then recognised. Little, if any, use was made
of the power thus given, and the Act was amended and
extended; but even then it was almost a dead letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>As years advanced great scientific discoveries demonstrated
the fact that some of the most dangerous diseases,
such as typhoid and scarlet fever, could be conveyed in
food of various sorts, and opened up a new vista of dangers
as to the conveyance of disease.<a id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> And the huge size of
London, and the vast numbers of its population, increased
enormously the difficulty of safeguarding the public from
the dangers of contaminated food.</p>

<p>The first and greater portion of this work was done by
the Corporation of the City of London. Its Committee, the
Port Sanitary Authority, was able to prevent large quantities
of bad meat which arrived by sea being put upon the
markets; and the Corporation, which administered the
principal markets of London—the cattle-markets at
Deptford and Islington, the fish-market at Billingsgate,
and the others at Smithfield and Leadenhall and Spitalfields—by
a system of inspection, prevented large quantities
of bad or diseased food being sold to the public.</p>

<p>In 1905, 415,000 tons of meat reached the Central
Smithfield Market, of which 2,128 tons were seized as
being diseased and unsound. At Billingsgate, 211,600 tons
of fish were delivered, of which 674 tons were condemned.
And there were 28 wharves and warehouses in the City
where tinned food and tinned meat and vegetables were
received. 173 tons were seized. All these places were
daily inspected.</p>

<p>This, however, was only a portion of the food which
reached London. The responsibility for inspecting food in
other parts of the metropolis rested (under the Public
Health (London) Act of 1891) with the various Sanitary
Authorities, and the reports of the Medical Officers of
Health contain accounts of inspections by them, and of the
seizure of meat, fish, poultry, rabbits, tinned food, vegetables,
eggs, and sweetmeats, and of prosecutions, and of a few
convictions. And many other articles of food were, under
the Food and Drugs Act of 1875–99, also liable to inspection
so as to secure that they should not be adulterated; so that
theoretically, and in a very great measure actually, provision
exists for protecting the people of London from adulterated
articles of food, and from food unfit for human consumption.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>
<p>All this is an immense advance upon the time when there
were no laws against the sale of unsound or adulterated
food.</p>

<p>But there is great room for improvement, for the
inspection and means of prevention are far from adequate
to secure the protection of the public from this danger;
indeed, the existing system of government for dealing
successfully with this most important element in the well-being
of the people is very defective.</p>

<p>The experiences of the past sixty years or so in London
have abundantly shown how great is the extent to which
the public health is dependent upon the system of local
government in existence at the time, and upon the
administration of the laws relating to the public health
by those authorities.</p>

<p>The considerable changes which have taken place in the
fifty years since the creation of a Central Authority, the
Metropolitan Board of Works, have been described.</p>

<p>So far as regarded the local authorities over the separate
areas into which London was divided, the “City” remains
practically as it was, with the exception of the addition to
its sphere of action of the important duties of Port Sanitary
Authority, and such further powers as the exigencies of the
times required, and certain changes consequent upon
the creation of the London County Council.</p>

<p>In the metropolis the other local sanitary authorities
instead of being Vestries and District Boards—43 in
number—are now Municipal Borough Councils—28 in
number—with some larger powers, including wide powers
of rating.</p>

<p>The Poor Law Guardians, also with wide powers of
rating, have remained much as they were, their sphere of
work being a definitely limited one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>Various Commissioners, such as the Commissioners of
Baths and Washhouses, Library Commissioners, and Burial
Boards, have ceased to be; their powers being now
exercised by the Borough Councils.</p>

<p>The important changes in the local government of the
metropolis have mainly been in the Central Authorities,
whose sphere of duties extends over the whole area of
London.</p>

<p>The principal Central Authority, the London County
Council, which superseded the Metropolitan Board of Works
in 1889, instead of being indirectly elected as was that body,
is a directly elected body, elected by and representative
of the whole electorate of London. Its duties and powers
have undergone extension and increase; the latest material
addition to them being its appointment as the Education
Authority for London.</p>

<p>In 1867, owing to the default of the Vestries and District
Boards to make provision of rate-supported hospitals for
paupers suffering from infectious or contagious disease, a
Central Authority—the Metropolitan Asylums Board—constituted
on the indirectly elected system, with considerable
powers to spend money which had to be provided out
of the rates of the metropolis, was created to do that work.</p>

<p>In 1870 another central body was created, the London
School Board, to deal with the elementary education of the
children of London, and though not a health authority, its
work was closely associated with the public health. It also
possessed the widest powers for spending money, which had
to be provided out of the rates of the metropolis. It was a
directly elected body, but elected on a system peculiar to
itself, and one which in great measure removed it from any
financial public control.</p>

<p>By an Act of Parliament in 1903 the London County
Council was made the Education Authority for London,
and the work of the School Board was transferred to it.</p>

<p>To the two existing central authorities was added, in
1903, another wholly gratuitous central local authority, the
Metropolitan Water Board, an indirectly elected body with
ultimate rating power over the metropolis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a third sphere of government in matters pertaining
to the public health—namely, that occupied by the
State. It is charged with many duties connected with the
public health, and is in close relationship with the various
central and local authorities in London. It has undergone
large changes since the middle of the last century.</p>

<p>At that time some of the powers possessed by the State
Government in health matters were exercised by one of the
Secretaries of State. Others, for some years, through the
General Board of Health appointed by the Government.
In 1858, when that Board ceased to exist, some of its powers
were transferred to the Privy Council, others lapsed to the
local sanitary authorities.</p>

<p>So great, as time went on, was the development of local
government throughout the country, and so essential was it
to have some central government State supervision over the
largely increased number of local sanitary authorities, that
in 1871 a new Government Department, the Local Government
Board, was created to perform this work. To it were
transferred most of the powers in connection with sanitation
and health matters possessed by the State Government, and
the various authorities in London came more or less under
its supervision. Since then, as the sanitary needs of the
community grew, and as legislation became more voluminous,
fresh duties have been constantly imposed upon that
Board.</p>

<p>Summing up these changes, and their broad effects, it is
to be said that the machinery for the administration of the
sanitary laws in London is undoubtedly far more potent and
effective than it has been at any previous time. Instead of
the Vestries and District Boards there are now the Borough
Councils; instead of the Metropolitan Board of Works there
is the London County Council; instead of the Privy Council
and Board of Health there is the Local Government Board,
whilst the Metropolitan Asylums Board and the Water
Board had no predecessors.</p>

<p>But on the other hand the system now in existence is
very complex, and in many ways cumbersome, and in recent
years there has been a most unfortunate tendency on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
part of Parliament to revert to that which was the curse of
London before the Act of 1855—the multiplicity of local
authorities—all of them, too, with separate rating powers.</p>

<p>So far, then, in the way of the machinery of local government
has London come on its way to an improved condition
of the public health.</p>

<p>And Parliament, as has been narrated, had, since 1855,
multiplied the health laws, which these bodies were charged
with the administration of. Then, the passing of an Act
dealing with matters affecting the public health was so rare
as to constitute a remarkable event. Now Acts of Parliament
and “Provisional Orders” as to health matters are
quite common events.</p>

<p>With such numerous laws covering so many phases of
the public health, with so much larger and more powerful
a machinery for their administration, the crucial point
of all is the administration of those laws by the various
authorities. It is obvious that the administration is much
more searching and effective and wide-reaching than it
has ever been before.</p>

<p>The Central Authority, the London County Council, has
done great work, as has already been shown, in extending and
maintaining the efficiency of the drainage system of London,
in the clearance of insanitary areas, and the erection of
houses for the working classes; in the acquisition of open
spaces, in great street improvements, in its efforts to help
towards a solution of the great housing problem by the
facilities of traffic it has created by its tramways, in the
inquiries it has instituted into the insanitary condition
of various districts in London, in the unifying of administration
by the local sanitary authorities, and in many other
ways too numerous to be recited. It has, in fact, vigorously
used such powers as it possessed.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Asylums Board has also used its powers
effectively, having erected hospitals, and having each year
successfully isolated and treated many thousands of cases
of infectious and contagious disease.</p>

<p>The Water Board is still too young to have a record.</p>

<p>The Poor Law Guardians had improved the workhouses
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
and the infirmaries, and the dispensaries were continuing
to do their useful work.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Borough Councils were grappling
with their numerous duties. The perusal of the annual
reports of these bodies shows their multiplicity. House-to-house
inspection—the inspection of factories and workshops,
and workplaces, and outworkers; of bakehouses,
cowsheds, dairies, and milkshops; of food and the places
where food is prepared; of offensive trades and slaughter-houses,
and of houses let in lodgings; the management
of baths and wash-houses, the removal of dust and filth,
disinfection, proceedings under the Housing of the Working
Classes Acts; measures for the prevention of disease, for
the abatement of nuisances, and many other duties connected
with sewerage, drainage, and paving and cleansing
of streets—all and every one of which closely affect the
health of the people.</p>

<p>The amount of work done varied considerably. In a
well-administered municipality the number of Sanitary
Inspectors had been increased, the number of inspections
was high, and the work continuous and heavy. In some,
however, the work was less satisfactorily done, and the
old Vestry antipathy to the expenditure of money upon
Inspectors appeared to have been handed on.</p>

<p>Much, nevertheless, was being done, and on the whole
matters appeared to be progressing satisfactorily, and in
many respects undoubtedly were doing so.</p>

<p>But every now and then some revelation occurred of
insanitary conditions under which large numbers of the
people were living which showed a grievous omission
somewhere, and for which some persons were responsible.</p>

<p>Thus when, under the Education (London) Act of 1903,
the County Council had to take over the non-provided
schools in London, the schools were inspected, and it was
found that their drains were generally in a very bad
condition. No fewer than 342, or 78 per cent. of the school
drains which were tested, were declared unsatisfactory.
A most prolific source of disease and death was thus laid
bare, a source which for years must have been working
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
grave evil—and as in these schools there were about 135,000
children in attendance, the number of persons involved
in danger was enormous.</p>

<p>Again, some of the figures published by the Census
Commissioners in 1902 disclosed a condition of things of
the utmost gravity.</p>

<p>Similar figures in the census of 1891 had passed almost
unnoticed; these of 1901 reiterated the story, and as the
evils they laid bare were on a somewhat smaller scale they
were hailed more as a mark of progress and improvement,
than as something portentous in themselves. Yet they
go down to the very roots of the sanitary condition of the
people of London, and show how great is the task to be
accomplished before the sanitary condition can be considered
satisfactory or even safe.</p>

<p>They bring into sudden view the fact that the problem
of the housing of the people is still unsolved.</p>

<p>The census of 1901 had recorded that there were
4,536,541 persons in London. It also recorded that the
total number of tenements was 1,019,546. It further
showed that of these tenements no fewer than 672,030
were tenements of less than five rooms; and then going
into details of these 672,030 tenements it showed <span class="no-break">that—</span><br /><br /></p>

<p class="p1">Still, therefore, well over half the population of London
lived in tenements of less than five rooms; whilst over
1,000,000 lived in tenements of one or two rooms—and
between one- and two-room tenements there is not much to
differentiate.</p>

<p>By further details given (as in 1891) each Sanitary
Authority was “provided with the means of examining
with much precision into the house accommodation of
its district.”</p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for the Borough of
Finsbury, utilising the figures for that Borough, deduced
some most instructive conclusions as to the effect of the
one-room and two-room tenements upon the death-rates.</p>

<p>Forty-six per cent. of the population lived in such tenements;
the death-rate in one-room tenements was 38·9 per
1,000; the death-rate in two-room tenements was 22·6 per
1,000. And the number of deaths occurring in them was 63
per cent. of all the deaths in the Borough.</p>

<p>“The conditions of life obtaining in one-room tenements,”
he added, “are such as tend towards poor physique, disease,
and death. The density of population is higher, the physical
restrictions are greater, and there is less fresh air and more
uncleanliness.”</p>

<p>The information thus given by the Census Commissioners
as to tenements was striking enough, but of deeper interest
and import even than these figures was the information as
to “Overcrowding.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>The Medical Officer of Health for the London County
Council, utilising the figures of the census, worked out
the facts as regarded the overcrowded tenement population
of London.</p>

<p>There were 726,096 persons living in an overcrowded state
in 124,773 tenements of less than five rooms. Of <span class="no-break">these—</span><br /><br /></p>

<p class="p1">There had been a reduction of overcrowded tenements
from 145,513 in 1891, containing 829,765 persons, to
124,773 in 1901, containing 726,096 persons.</p>

<p>There would appear then to be some hope that the acme
or climax of overcrowding has been passed. But even
from the most sanguine point of view the improvement
is not great, and many decades would have to elapse before
“overcrowding” ceased to be a power for evil.</p>

<p>A few illustrations show the dreadful condition of things
in this respect in certain localities.</p>

<p>In the Borough of Finsbury, over 35,000 persons lived
in overcrowded tenements of less than five rooms; in
Stepney, 99,000; in Islington, 56,000; in St. Pancras, 56,000;
in Lambeth, a few short of 37,000; and in Southwark, over
46,000.</p>

<p>And if some of the figures about overcrowding were
looked into a little more minutely it was to be seen that
in St. Marylebone there were 1,020 two-room tenements
inhabited by five persons each, 685 by six persons each,
366 by seven persons each, and 170 by eight persons each.</p>

<p>In Islington there were 1,253 such tenements with six
persons each, 624 with seven persons, and 258 with eight
persons.</p>

<p>In St. Pancras there were 1,414 two-room tenements
with six persons in each, 743 with seven persons in each,
and 323 with eight in each.</p>

<p>In Shoreditch there were 694 two-room tenements with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
six persons in each, 380 with seven in each, and 155 with
eight in each.</p>

<p>Stepney was the worst of all—with 1,126 two-room
tenements with seven persons in each, 577 with eight
persons in each, and 278 with nine persons in each; but
this was the result of alien immigration.</p>

<p>In Lambeth there were 699 tenements of two rooms
with six people in each, and 322 similar tenements with
seven each, and 118 with eight each.</p>

<p>It must have come as a revelation to many of the
Borough Councils to find such a condition of things existing
in their municipality.</p>

<p>These are the most recent reliable figures. Not much
change can have taken place since then, and they may
be regarded as presenting fairly well the existing condition
of the housing of the people of London.</p>

<p>The main fact emerging from them is that a population
of 726,096 persons in London are living in 124,733
overcrowded tenements of less than five rooms.</p>

<p>The accumulated testimony of the most experienced and
capable observers during half a century is clear and precise
that overcrowding is disastrous to the physical welfare of
the individual. The conditions of life are not much better
in one- and two-roomed tenements, and the conclusion is
thus forced upon us that, speaking broadly, a fifth of the
population of London are at present living in circumstances
where physical well-being is impossible, and where
even a moderate standard of public health is unattainable.</p>

<p>For some time back, fears as to the physical deterioration
of certain classes of the population have found public
expression, and to such a point did these misgivings come
that, in 1903, a Committee was appointed by the Lord
President of the Council to inquire into the subject throughout
the kingdom.</p>

<p>The idea of physical deterioration being at work found
expression sometimes in the reports of the Medical Officers
of Health even far back. Thus, in 1869, the Medical Officer
of Health for Paddington <span class="no-break">wrote:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>“In Paddington overcrowding in its worst forms cannot
be said to exist, but there is an over-concentration of
building which will some day be considered a disgrace
to our civilisation. It may safely be predicted that besides
a high infantile death-rate a concomitant deterioration of
race will result…. This high (infantile) death-rate is not
the only check to population. Another and more painful
form of evil manifests itself in the sickly and puny race
around us. Young men and young women are unable from
low vitality to cope with their contemporaries in the labour
market, where prolonged muscular exertion is required.
We find in this class the seeds of debility and disease.”</p>

<p>In 1871 he gave a table with particulars of five hundred
heads of families of the wage-earning class engaged in
industrial occupations living in tenement-houses in certain
streets near the Great Western Railway terminus. “Sixty-four
per cent. were born in country places. This,” he added,
“confirms my statement in former reports that large
numbers of men born in cities have poor constitutions
and deficient vital stamina, who cannot cope with their
competitors from the country, nor command the best labour
markets of the world. In the struggles of town-life large
numbers are prematurely crushed out at early periods of
their existence.”</p>

<p>And he added: “This deterioration of race has for some
time been recognised by Medical Officers of Health.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately the conditions of life conducive to deterioration
did not cease to exist in 1871, as evidenced
by the figures of the censuses of 1891 and 1901, of the
population living in overcrowded tenements of less than
five rooms.</p>

<p>The Committee reported in 1904, but while both the
Report and the evidence are of great interest, it cannot
be said that they advanced the question much.</p>

<p>The Committee stated <span class="no-break">that—</span></p>

<p>“There are no sufficient ‘data’ at present obtainable for
a comparative estimate of the health and physique of
the people.”</p>

<p>That being undoubtedly so, the best light obtainable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
on the subject must be sought for in a different way.
Fortunately that way exists—and it is possibly the soundest
of all—the method of inference from well-established facts.</p>

<p>The reports of the Medical Officers of Health for London
during the last half-century enable this method to be applied
to London.</p>

<p>In cases innumerable it has been demonstrated beyond
dispute that the death-rate was highest in overcrowded
houses or localities, that the sick-rate was proportionately
higher, that disease assumed more virulent form in them,
and left the victim in a more impaired condition.</p>

<p>“It is almost an axiom that the greater the crowding,
the greater the sickness and the higher the death-rate.”</p>

<p>That these conditions affect the health and stamina of
persons of all ages, and more especially of the children who
are to constitute the new generation, is a truism, and thus
the health and stamina of a large proportion of the population
is, of necessity, damaged and deteriorated, and a heritage of
suffering and debility passes to a succeeding generation.
Were these evils mere passing events like an epidemic
of cholera which sweeps away its thousands of victims and
is gone, the results would not be so disastrous.</p>

<p>But when to these clearly proved facts is added the awful
fact that these evils have been unceasingly in active
operation for considerably more than half a century, that
the past is still exerting a powerful and pernicious effect
upon the present, and that the seeds of evil then sown are
still producing a deadly crop, it is a necessary and unavoidable
conclusion that there has been a considerable deterioration
of race.</p>

<p>Counteracting these deadly forces have been those which
have been described in this <span class="no-break">book:—</span></p>

<p>Efficient sewerage and drainage, water supply improved
in quantity and quality, sounder food, wider thoroughfares,
cleaner streets, open spaces, new dwellings, prevention of
the defilement of the atmosphere, prevention of the spread
of infection—all these, together with better knowledge of
health matters, the vast advance in medical science, the
better provision for the treatment of the sick, greater
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
temperance, and the great work carried on by numerous
philanthropic workers and organisations, have effected vast
improvement—an improvement testified to in the fall in the
death-rate of London from 23·38 per 1,000 in 1851 to 17·1 in
1901 since which year it has further decreased.</p>

<p>Painfully and laboriously, and in the face of persistent
obstruction and hostility, has the present sanitary position
been attained. “Vested rights in filth and dirt” have
offered a prolonged and dogged fight against reforms which
curtailed their privileges. Hundreds of thousands of lives
have been needlessly cast away, an uncountable number
blighted and made useless by diseases which were preventable,
and which were not prevented, and an incalculable
injury inflicted upon the community.</p>

<p>And the expense to the community has been enormous.
Millions upon millions of money have had to be spent to
make good—so far as could be made good—the ravages
of past neglect and culpable management. Millions upon
drainage, upon hospitals, upon houses for the working
classes, upon open spaces—tens of millions upon water
supply, and most unjustifiable and regrettable of all, millions
to compensate slum owners for their iniquities.</p>

<p>And even yet we have not arrived at our goal. What,
then, are still the causes of failure? What the impediments?
Where the shortcomings?</p>

<p>The failure is in part due to a great omission by Parliament—in
part to the non-administration of existing laws
by local authorities—in part to a great defect in the system
of local government.</p>

<p>Parliament had, most unfortunately, omitted from all its
enactments affecting London any provision for the supervision
of the great movement in part economic, in part
social, which has been going on in London for well-nigh
two-thirds of a century—namely, the change of houses
inhabited by one family into tenement-houses, or houses
inhabited by several families.</p>

<p>That movement with its appalling attendant evils was
allowed to go on practically unregulated, uncontrolled,
and unsupervised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>The great evil of this movement was, that a house which
had been structurally and sanitarily designed for one family
was sanitarily unsuited for its altered career as the abode of
several families. Nothing was done to obviate this evil.
And so these houses became packed with people and families
who had to live in one or two rooms in them without the
primary necessities of a healthy existence—without ventilation—without
an adequate supply of water—without
facilities for cooking food—with the scantiest and filthiest
sanitary accommodation—had to live under conditions
which put a high premium upon dirt and insanitation, and
which absolutely invited disease and death.</p>

<p>Even the Sanitary Act of 1866, and its amending Act of
1874, did not deal with this crucial matter; and no legal
obligation was created by Parliament to ensure that the
houses undergoing such a change should be adapted to their
altered circumstances.</p>

<p>The Sanitary Act of 1866 only in part dealt with the
evils inherent in such houses. It imposed on the Sanitary
Authority the duty of making regulations which prescribed
a standard of the air space for each person, and thus made
an effort to prevent overcrowding; it imposed upon the
“owner” the duty of maintaining a certain standard of
cleanliness—the rooms were to be painted or lime-whitened
every year—it laid upon the tenants certain duties also
as to maintaining cleanliness.</p>

<p>But even this imperfect legislation was completely
brought to naught by the opposition of the Vestries and
District Boards to such action as would have secured at any
rate some degree of decent accommodation in the tenement-houses
of London.</p>

<p>By the Public Health Act, 1891, the London County
Council was empowered to make bye-laws enforcing a
certain standard of sanitary accommodation in them, and
did make them. But in other respects nothing was done;
and so the process still goes on, large numbers of houses
hitherto occupied by one family are passing into the occupation
of several families devoid of the primary necessaries of
a healthy existence. The great movement has by no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
means spent its force; for long to come houses will be
going through this transition, and until legislation deals
definitely with this matter the inevitable evils attendant on
the change will continue.</p>

<p>The second main cause of failure lies at the door of the
local authorities who would not and did not administer the
existing laws.</p>

<p>The local governing authorities are now more active than
they have ever been before; the amount of work done in
every branch of sanitation is far greater than ever before;
the number of Sanitary Inspectors has been increased from
188 in 1893 to 313 in 1904. But the regulations or
bye-laws under the Act of 1891 which Parliament had
imperatively directed them to make and to use as regarded
the tenement-houses in London, are very far from being
enforced to the extent they should be.</p>

<p>The total number of houses let in lodgings which were on
the various registers in 1905 was 22,257.</p>

<p>With only a few exceptions the Borough Councils, like
their predecessors the Vestries, make comparatively little
use of this power, though there is a concurrent mass of
testimony as to the beneficial results following its use.
Stepney, under the inrush of aliens, found the benefit of
exercising the power, and heads the list with 2,672 houses
on the register. Kensington has 2,107; Westminster 1,641;
St. Pancras 2,192; Hammersmith 2,266; and Finsbury
1,169. These amount to 12,047, or 10 per cent. of all the
inhabited houses in those six boroughs. In the whole of
the rest of London with 451,596 inhabited houses, only
10,207 of the houses let in lodgings are registered: so that
only 2¼ per cent. of the houses in them, as against 10 per
cent. in the others, are registered.</p>

<p>It is manifest, therefore, how imperfectly the greater
number of even the present local authorities perform the
duty which has been imperatively imposed upon them by
Parliament.</p>

<p>The Borough of Shoreditch, for instance, with 22,940
tenements of less than five rooms, of which 6,269 were overcrowded
with 35,500 persons living in them, has only 283 of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
the houses let in lodgings on the register. The Borough of
Lambeth with 44,495 tenements of less than five rooms,
of which 6,548 were overcrowded with 36,900 people living
in them, had only 372 houses on the register. The Borough
of Bermondsey with over 25,000 persons living in overcrowded
tenements had only 221 houses on the register.</p>

<p>This, as has been explained (<a href="#Page_377">see p. 377</a>), is not a matter in
which the Central Authority, the London County Council,
has any authority to interfere. The Borough Councils are
their own masters in this matter, as were their predecessors
the Vestries, and the responsibility as to administering or
not administering in their areas the Act of Parliament
rests entirely with them. The consequences of the non-administration
of these bye-laws to the health and physical
well-being of great masses of the people are disastrous.</p>

<p>Various legal decisions in recent years have somewhat
impeded the effective administration of the bye-laws in this
matter, but the real impediment is the dislike to them of
the Borough Councils.</p>

<p>The condition of the vast tenement-house population in
this great city is of such immeasurable consequence to the
community at large that matters can only be allowed to
continue in their present most unsatisfactory state at the
most dire cost. The sooner it is thoroughly inquired into
by Parliament and drastically dealt with the better; great
evils will be stayed, great benefits will be secured.</p>

<p>The third principal cause of failure to attain a higher
level of the public health in London than at present
enjoyed has been the want of a real central Health
Authority. The Metropolitan Board of Works was never
such. The London County Council is only such in a very
limited way. A real central Health Authority for London
is an absolute necessity—that is the great moral to be
drawn from the history of the last half-century so far as
local government in health matters in London is concerned.</p>

<p>Disease recognises no boundaries, and in a great city like
London it is essential that in so vital a matter as the public
health full authority should, subject to Parliament, be
vested in one supreme authority—a central authority which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
shall secure uniformity of administration; a central
authority which shall be able to compel a local authority
in London to do that which if it neglects is a danger to the
community; a central authority which, in the event of such
neglect, shall be authorised itself to undertake that work; a
central authority which shall be able to act at once for
London as a whole in presence of any sudden or great
emergency—that is absolutely essential for the sanitary
safety of this great city and of the millions who live in it.</p>

<p>The want of such an authority has throughout the whole
sanitary evolution of London been a disaster of the greatest
magnitude, and is an ever-present peril to this great
metropolis. The existence now of a central popularly
elected representative body for the metropolis would render
this reform quite a simple matter.</p>

<p>Further measures are also required to aid in the removal
of the worst of London evils.</p>

<p>In 1903 a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire
into the means of locomotion and transport in London. It
reported in 1905, having done its work more thoroughly
than even most Royal Commissions do their work.</p>

<p>A great portion of its report deals directly or indirectly
with the sanitary condition of the people of London.</p>

<p>“The question of locomotion,” said the Commissioners,
“affects the health, comfort, and efficiency for work of the
whole community….</p>

<p>“Witnesses who have special knowledge of the subject
are of opinion that the remedy for overcrowding is to be
found in the removal of the people to outside districts by
providing additional facilities for locomotion, and in this
opinion we agree….</p>

<p>“We have come to the conclusion that in order to relieve
overcrowding means must be provided for taking the
population into and out of London, not in one or two
directions but in many directions, at rapid speed, frequent
intervals, and cheap rates.”</p>

<p>To this recommendation of the Commission it should be
added that means must be devised for preventing in “outer
London” a repetition of those circumstances and conditions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
of life which, for more than half a century, entailed such
sufferings and evils upon the people of London.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In reviewing the principal events, and studying the
powerful underlying forces of the great movement of the
sanitary evolution of London, the bitter experiences of the
time gone by would indeed have been in vain if they did
not point the way to an avoidance of past blunders and
iniquities, and towards a better and happier future for the
people. The lines upon which reform should move
gradually become apparent as the events unroll themselves;
and the measures now to be taken evolve and shape themselves
from the successes and failures of the past.</p>

<p>The reforms just suggested are undoubtedly those which
are most imperatively necessary. The whole experience of
the past justifies the belief that they would soon work a
great change for the better in the physical, mental, and
moral conditions of life of large masses of the people of
London. And from improved and healthier homes would
come to the people increased comforts and happiness, and
more physical energy and greater strength to fulfil the duties
of their lives, and to meet whatever demands the future
may make upon them and upon our nation.</p>

<p>The strength and even the existence of a nation depend
upon the health of its masses. The stake at issue is a vital
one to people and nation; and now more than ever is it
necessary that the health and vigour of our race should be
maintained at the highest possible attainable standard.</p>

of some of the Vestries. Thus, in 1891, the Vestry of Westminster
complained of the lack of public interest in the record of their proceedings.
“Only eleven ratepayers out of 8,800 have purchased copies
(price 2d.) of the Reports of the Vestry in each of the last three years.”
(A few years later they reduced their Reports to a few pages.)<br />
<br />
And in 1896 the Vestry of Kensington complained of the limited
demand for their Annual Report, though it only cost 2d.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
